Don't use if you are a freelancer trying to get paid,"Trying to get paid as a music composer working with gamedevs overseas is an absolute nightmare with Paypal. Because the 2nd payment I have received has taken the total amount paid to over $500 NZD, Paypal has arbitraily decided to hold most of my payment. Apparently I need to announce that my ""order has been completed"" which I've done but gives me no guarantee of how long I'll have to wait until I have the whole balance. Then I'll have to transfer it to my bank account which also took ages last time. Not to mention the fee percentage isn't too great at all...",1,2023-09-25T04:08:59.000Z,William Braddell

So, my complaint is mostly with the user interface on android. I could not figure out how to delete a bank account at first, so I just added another account to transact with. I specifically remember directing paypal to send the transaction to the new bank account but I guess the system defaulted to sending it to my old bank account. One day later, I checked to see if my money was there and it was not. I checked the app and it said it sent it to the old account. I am so angry about this!

I won't be using PayPal too much now as they seem to be Incompetent, to me it is simple if you dont receive goods you can't return them, therefore you can't produce a returns proof, and you are not liable to pay for goods you have not received, PayPal can't seen to grasp this concept!",1,2023-09-24T01:08:15.000Z,Customer
Fraudsters,I brought an item on eBay using pay in 3. I paid the first instalment but the item was defective. I returned the item to the seller and requested a refund of the £102 I paid.

I have no goods as it was sent back but they are refusing to pay me because the seller hasn’t paid them. They used to be good but now are just total scam merchants.

End of my longterm relationship with PaypalI,"I have been using Paypal for several years when making a purchase.  I will not use them ever again because recently I bought an item from Wowcher and paid by Paypal. The item never arrived mainly due to me not understanding how Wowcher worked which resulted in me not getting the item which I had paid for. I could not get in touch with Wowcher, no surprise there, as we live in a world where there is less and less contact with humans.  I then got in touch with Paypal and they were hopeless, could do nothing to help me.  So that is my relationship done with them.  I cannot see the benefit of their service.  Thankfully I paid by credit card and called them who sorted it out immediately.  Now today Wowcher after my review on Trustpilot about my experience with them have refunded me my monies in full.  What a shambles we all are responsible for buying on line and closing all our lovely high street shops.  Many in small towns are family owned businesses and there is where you get the very best customer service.  We should not forget this.  We are creating a world where humans are being pushed out in favour of greed and faceless businesses that make it impossible to make contact with them.

I provided the following information; a copy of the receipt, a picture of the item in comparison to another item to show it was not as described, and the information for the real item that the seller copied/imitated. This was not good enough and PayPal denied my request for a refund three times because they could not find the original listing for the item as the seller pulled it down when I filed the dispute. On top of this, the last person I spoke with from PayPal customer support was extremely rude and unhelpful. Apparently on top of the information I already provided I needed the listing of the item too.  This is a MASSIVE flaw in Paypal's system that this seller was aware of and took advantage of.

I then was gobsmacked when I was told I had to pay for the pallet return at a cost of over half of the £200 purchase and that was at my expense  .

Never trust PayPal with your money.,"Never trust your money with PayPal. Even if you call and tell them, that you are being scammed through their app. They, will still allow, the scammer to scam someone, out of money. They will go ahead and pay the scammer, even though they were told that they were a scam. So don't trust your money with PayPal, because it's not safe. The scammer was scamming me out of $504. And PayPal took it up on themselves to go into my account and take out $100, out of account that was closed down. And then they paid $390 of their own money knowing that it was a scam because, They had been told, for 4 weeks before they released the money, to the scammer. It's better to get yourself a credit card to pay for your purchases online. That way you don't get scammed or ripped off. Like you would if you were dealing with PayPal. And this was after, PayPal allowed them to scam me out of $1,000, and see nothing wrong with it, because they allow scammers to scam you. Because that's their policy. To allow your bank to be someone else's, way of profiting off of you. When it was all said and done I was scammed for over $2,000.

Paypal,I have been using PayPal for 15 years and in all that time I have opened two disputes for non arrival of goods (small amounts) so not a great loss but luckily PP refunded me. I use PayPal almost daily as I shop ALOT. It is so convenient when shopping online and have actually not bought items from unfamiliar websites because they don’t use it for payment and I prefer to have the protection it offers. I can’t understand the amount of negative reviews.

Very functional,"My overall experience with PayPal as a buyer is pretty positive. And of course as a seller it’s going to be more difficult as you have too build a basis for yourself so you can come across as trust worthy. It seems the app really has a no scammer policy for the most part, and I believe most disputes are opened and handles fairly if not a bit extended and over due. I think that the buyer protection is a very amazing option that not many other concealed cash apps have, and I think the app has very good security for the most part.",4,2023-09-13T08:18:22.000Z,Doug
Use PayPal with extreme caution,"Fur Babies Rescue is a very small domestic animal rescue in Hickory, NC. 100% of all funds received into the rescue are used to make the lives of domestic animals better. This is an organization run by volunteers. No one takes a salary or receives any financial compensation. All of our volunteers are local professionals working together to make our community better.  Fur Babies Rescue had used PayPal to accept donations and also use it for a fundraising tool. We found out the hard way that PayPal can freeze an account and hold the money for 180 days. The account was frozen and now PayPal has control of $1,693.22 of the rescue’s funds. Those funds were going to help spay/neuter and vaccinate approximately 20 animals in need. We had to cancel the trip to the spay clinic that was scheduled for September 20, 2023. We should have done our homework before signing up to use PayPal. If you Google “PayPal froze my account” you will find many horror stories and lawsuits because PayPal froze accounts. There isn’t an easy way to dispute the account freeze or get help from PayPal.

Paypal will rip you off.,"This paypal company supports a third party company called Click Wu LLC, whereby Click Wu LLC charges you unauthorized payments when you think you're purchasing other products. When you contact Click Wu LLC, you will receive no response, and when you contact paypal they will support this piece of crap company and refuse to refund your money. Neither company supports customers. Do not be fooled by fb ads for anything, especially political crap. They're all in collusion to rip you off.",1,2023-09-08T02:11:06.000Z,Alicen Sosnowski
Customer service is horrible,"Customer service is horrible. They will lie to you. Then when you try to send somebody money they hold the money for up to over a week and that’s not what you’re wanting to do when you send somebody money on PayPal you want it to go through immediately instead of them sitting on the money instead of PayPal, sitting on the money and collecting the interest. Now they are making you load money into PayPal so that you can use your debit card just another rate for them to make money off of you and interest. You’re better off with your bank or regular credit card. PayPal froze my account because my credit card company realized before me that somebody had stole my wallet and my phone out of my purse and was committing fraud. All of my credit card companies and my bank understood this and immediately turn down the charges PayPal is trying to make me pay the charges that went through that were fraudulent. They are the only company that has given me any trouble and they have giving me trouble day after day after day they will not even allow me to close my account.",1,2023-09-17T21:13:26.000Z,Nancy Smith

PayPal is not great for business accounts,"As a Shopify store owner, I thought using PayPal to accept payment for my items would be great. After losing the first payment, I thought it was my fault, and I accepted the blame and sent the customer the item anyway. Now, I am in the same boat again with PayPal for a more significant amount. After a week of going back and forth between who was at fault with Shopify and PayPal, I am still without the payment and the items once again has been shipped. I will no longer offer PayPal in my store as a means of payment. Nobody seems to know where the money magically went to.

LOSS OF TRUST IN PAYPAL,"I have used PayPal for many years when making online purchases.  I trusted this service completely until recently when two online transactions, totalling £133,80 were debited by PayPal from my bank account.I did not order/agree to buy the goods in question.  Nor did I authorise the debits for such from my account.  The goods were unsolicited; the payments unauthorised.I notified the seller, Label Products, and PayPal of these unsolicited goods and the unauthorised payments for such via PayPal.  I informed both parties that my intention was to return the goods and seek a full refund.What followed comprised poor management of a customer's concerns by Label Products and, more disappointingly, PayPal.In essence, both parties inferred I was being less than truthful about my claim.  The seller argued the two sales were legitimate.  Paypal's resolution facility determined the debits were authorised.Label Products then embarked on a path to convince me not to return the goods by offering me a 20% discount on the purchases.  I refused as I did not want or order the items, or authorise the payment for them.  This was followed up by a further offer of a 30% discount if I kept the unsolicited goods.  I refused and advised that, as they were not listening to me, I would pursue the matter through the small claims court.It was after this response to the seller, that I was contacted by PayPal.  Surprisingly, they stated that, following my appeal, they now considered the transactions were unauthorised and they would refund my payments in full.Whilst happy the correct decision had been made - eventually, I was somewhat confused regarding the sudden u-turn by PayPal. Also, I had not appealed their original decision as inferred by PayPal, as I was considering my options.I still await an explanation from PayPal why a decision that the debits were authorised was changed to their present unauthorised status.When I queried PayPal about when the refund would be made, they responded by saying they had no knowledge of my refund.Later that day, however, I received a refund from PayPal for the full amount.I still await further contact from the seller relative to the return of the unsolicited goods.I have lost all trust in PayPal after these events.  They have been less than transparent with me over this whole fiasco.I have since emailed PayPal's enquiries section and stated my intention to close my account with the company. No response received.I have attempted, in vain, to close my PayPal account via their app.  On each of eight occasions, over several days, I was confronted with the message, 'We are sorry we are not able to process your request.  Please try again in a little while.'I have contacted PayPal's enquiries section again and given notification that, with immediate effect, I was closing my account and they were no longer authorised access to any of my bank accounts. I have waited more than, '.. a little while...' for Paypal's explanation why they initially declared the debits authorised, then changed their finding to unauthorised.  Also, I have had no contact from them to confirm the closure of my account.",1,2023-09-25T14:38:03.000Z,Peter Milne

Pay through Paypal for the security? Don't bother,"I raised a dispute through them because Debenhams owe me some money for a Return. Debenhams contnually wrote and said 'Send us details'. 16 times I've sent photos and proof of postage. In the end I go to Paypal. Told them the whole story in detail and sent all the necessary proof to them as well. After waiting a month I get an email saying 'Debenhams say you must return the item and then they'll give you the refund'The automated helpline tells me they are waiting for information from Debenhams and can't help further. Clearly wrong, as evidenced by their email.  Maybe Paypal staff can't read, which I can only assume is the case here. There is a training opportunity for them here. Absolutely unbelievable. I only ever buy through Paypal because of the supposed support and security. Obviously not worth doing so will bypass them from now on. Beyond rubbish service.

There is nowhere for me to object to this decision. Sending the faulty item back will be more expensive than the original product.

PayPal is a scam! they take your money then charge you for an instant release and/or transfer of your money and then tell you 24-72hrs then procced to take 7 business days which always means basically two weeks since they don't process on weekends just to collect interest on your money.I will be looking into a class action lawsuit against PayPal for this, it is absolutely unacceptable in this in age and a complete scam of a business.",1,2023-09-05T19:16:23.000Z,Joseph Brown

Also, they gave seller nearly two weeks to reply however would only give me 3 days to provide evidence.

Avoid if you're a dev or company looking for a payment processor integration,"For a regular consumer like me, PayPal is just okay, but if you're a developer aiming to utilize their API for payment integration, PayPal is downright terrible. PayPal for developers is troublesome for several reasons:- Their documentation is subpar. Not because it's poorly written, but due to its confusing navigation. Finding the necessary information is a real challenge, and it's hard to make sense of it. Additionally, they often omit details about certain restricted APIs.- PayPal's support is equally frustrating. Their response times are excruciatingly slow. The typical workflow goes like this: You describe your issue, then wait for a day. The next day, when their response finally arrives, you reply, and the cycle continues with another day of waiting. Furthermore, their staff can be quite inept. They may offer incorrect advice initially, only for another staff member to correct it days later. It's simply absurd.I strongly advise against using PayPal. If you require payment support, opt for Stripe instead. It is light years ahead in terms of quality and developer-friendliness.",1,2023-09-02T12:12:27.000Z,Nicolas Dao

Even though they know all this to be true, they still ask me to deliver them anyway, and have done in hundreds of messages and emails over several week as I've argued the insanity of what they're asking.To top it off, all the formal complaints I've made about their customer service get replies with email I can't reply to because they don't allow replies, yet those same emails ask me to reply to the emails. Meaning they've created a situation when my complaints won't be dealt with because I have no way of replying to their complaints team emails.PayPal have gone above and beyond to be the absolute worst customer service I've ever had to deal with.

Absolutely Awful Customer Service,"Absolutely Awful. My bank that I have been using on PayPal for over 10 years suddenly stopped working, and I had to call PayPal to figure out what was wrong and resolve it because I was unable to fix it by resetting the connection to the bank myself. They told me it had become ""unverified"" and had to be verified by them with me calling in. They could not explain to me why it became unverified suddenly, and could not answer if it would happen again. They just kept dodging questions and talking in circles and it drove me NUTS. Just wasted my time and acted like I was crazy for being upset. I asked to talk to a manager and GOT HUNG UP ON.So, I decided to close my account. This is how I learned basically all of their customer support is incompetent, and it wasn't just bad luck before. I could not close my own account because for whatever reason, I had a -0.01 USD balance and +0.01 AUD balance, and despite showing a 0.00 overall balance, this odd discrepancy was preventing my account from being closed.  I tried to transfer the AUD to USD, but it failed and just said it can't be done right now.I was told by Customer Service that they couldn't fix the issue, and transferred me to Collections, and I was transferred back and forth like this for over an hour with NO HELP WHATSOEVER. They just kept saying it was the other teams problem. I finally landed someone competent from Customer Service who was able to close my account, but by this point I can't recommend PayPal to ANYONE. Awful, unorganized, uncommunicative customer support who just try to get you off the phone any way that they can because they don't actually know how to do anything.

"Unethical, perhaps illegal practices","On August 7, 2023, I signed up for a 30-day FREE TRIAL - My PayPal account was charged $1.00 and I used the service once - I had NO INTENTION of subscribing to the service, but PayPal took it upon itself to invoice me. When I called PayPal to explain, they suggested I open a case, I did - and then they have the audacity to in initiate an UNAUTHORIZED transfer - funds which I did NOT have in my PP account, to my checking account, putting me into OVERDRAFT. I tried to call Vimeo@ 646-470-8422 - I don't know if this is a fax number, but NOBODY ever answers, and this IS the number that PayPal gave me to call to speak to you directly. So, let's recap:A)I took the misguided action of asking for a 30-day FREE TRIAL with Vimeo and charged $1.00 by PayPal. B) PayPal draws up an invoice and is haranguing me for $261.00 for what was to be a FREE trial on September 1 - a week to go on my alleged FREE trial has yet to end. C) PayPal takes funds that were NOT in my account and they initiate a transfer for $236.84 - totally and completely unauthorized - to my checking account and putting me in NEGATIVE territory.  I have opened a FRAUD case with my bank for this daring of PayPal to take this initiative - and, by the way, VIMEO, whatever became of this alleged FREE 30-day trial?

Unjustified withholding of MY MONEY by PayPal,"A large amount of a payment made to me, from an item that I sold to a friend, was put on hold by PayPal. For no reason, other than some idiotic policy that PayPal has put in place, I can only receive a total of $300.00 a month, of MY MONEY! This means that MY MONEY is being held hostage by PayPal, so that PayPal can draw interest in their bank account! I messaged PayPal twice, trying to resolve the issue, but got no response. The next day, I called PayPal, and was shocked to find that my call was being taken by AI (Artificial Idiot)! After almost screaming at this Robot, that I wanted to speak to a Human, it finally asked if I would like to speak to a representative! Yes...I screamed! After holding for a bit, another Robot answered the phone! This Robot finally asked if I would like for a representative to call me back within 30-45 minutes. Finally I get a call back from another Robot, that asked me to state my name. Back on hold I go! After a bit, an actual person came on line, and could only recite to me, what was listed in the PayPal general articles. I said that if she could not actually help me, I wanted to speak to a supervisor. After a while, a supervisor came on line, with an accent that very difficult for me to understand. I asked where she was located, and she said ""offshore"". After listening to her ramble on for a bit, reciting the same old PayPal articles, I said ""this is enough""! ""Can you help me resolve this insane issue""? She offered no solution, and was not interested in helping. She was not interested in my frustration, or dissatisfaction in PayPal. At this point, I can only hope that PayPal will not steal MY MONEY, and that I will someday get it! As soon as I do, I will close all ties with PayPal, and recommend that nobody ever uses their services!! I do not trust them any more!!!! Beware!!!!",1,2023-09-09T19:06:12.000Z,David Elliott

I loathe to give a one star,"I loathe to give a one star.  Purchased two items from House of Fraser via Pay in Three.  Received the two items, returned the two items, took a picture of the return invoice, asked for the Evri return receipt and dropped at the local Evri drop point.  I went off on holidays for a couple of weeks, got back and contact Paypal about the refund.  Only refunded 1/3 of payment.  Why?  They said they'd investigate.  Came pack with reply you've been refunded.  To cut to the chase I have spent the last 6 weeks sending over 20 messages via the stupid APP (they don't want you to have a record), uploaded over 15 documents, made four antagonising phone calls to a different customer service rep everytime who does little to review the case and never once do they responded to the question I ask of them.  You've received the refund and failed to provide us with information is all I get.  So I get onto HoF.  Well at least they responded adequately and sent me pictures.  Yes, the package did arrive back but I can see the jumper, the most expensive item worth £200 has been removed and the package re-taped.  So in fairness, HoF have received the package with a missing item.  Now I thought my good friends at Paypal would cover something like this but no.  You would think that a looking through my history, I've been with them for 20 years with a clean slate.  Nope!  So today, I reluctantly paid the final instalmant (three weeks before it is due) for items I returned.  I've removed all my cards and tried to close my Paypal account.  It won't close.  So I message then again, and ask kindly how I do this.  Guess what.  I receive a reply about how they tried to reopen the case and they hope I understand as a valued customer, blah blah but no information on how to close by account.  Seriously, there is nothing you can do about these fraudulent companies other than write a review.  STAY AWAY FROM PAYPAL.  STAY AWAY FROM EVRI (that will be in my next review)",1,2023-09-08T17:02:10.000Z,vicki wood

I don’t even know why I’m bothering to…,"I don’t even know why I’m bothering to write a review on here, because PayPal won’t see it or bother replying back to me . I have just used PayPal’s 3 payment option to pay for an urgent head scan. They have taken the first payment from my bank account, but the scan company haven’t receive my payment yet. So they can’t hold my appointment for me, until a payment has been received. Which means the appointment will be offered to someone else instead. And I’ll have to wait longer for my head scan. Paypal is saying it can take a few days for the 3 payment plan to be approved. So why take money from my bank account if you haven’t even approved my payment plan yet?I can’t book another scan until I get my money back. I’m so angry.It’s saying on paypals website that I can’t cancel the payment plan.   So how am I meant to get my money back?My bank said they can’t cancel the payment either.

Abusive,"I've been PayPal user for so long... Unfortunately, it is becoming more and more abusive. It's been a week now and I haven't received the the money I transferred from my PayPal account to my Bank account. There is no reason PayPal is blocking my moneyI will withdraw all my money will stop using PayPal. The worst part is they are lying, when I first called, they said it was my bank, the money was transferred but my bank hasn't updated their system. The next day, another person from customer service said is shouldn't worry they will make the transfer within the next 2 days. I am not worried, I just want my money to be in my account asap.I keep on calling and the waiting times are 40 min to 1 h. Today I message them they say up 7 days wait for transfer. I called to complain again and the last person I spoke said because of new regulations, there is up to 10 days wait. When I asked why this new regulations wasn't communicated with me... he said it was, but I never received any notification about change of rules and transfers wait time up to 10 days. Instead, with each transfer confirmation e mail I receive this message: ""It could take 1-2 business days for the money to appear in your bank account, depending on your bank. If it takes longer, please contact your bank.""Such an abusive behaviour.",1,2023-08-29T17:31:24.000Z,Aleksandra Stevanoska

Paypal Fiasco Chronicle 2023,"Updated Review 2 :Paypal has finally come to its senses and reinstated my account. However, this issue has taken a toll on my business, since I used my Stripe payouts to pay customers when Paypal funds were on hold, and even before I only used Paypal to pay for Facebook ads, because Paypal wouldn't allow me to link a bank account. Once I try to do so, and click on ""link bank"" it forwards me to the main dashboard. I've reported this issue over a month ago, and they said it's a regional problem and they'll fix it soon from their end. However, it must be an intentional thing, because an american friend of mine has shown me that he's able to do so. Paypal also isn't allowing me to add a US debit card, because they limit the billing addresses you add to the country you opened your Paypal from.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Updated Review 1 : Reference ID: PP-L-426159964349After making several attempts to contact all the channels I have access to, be it through email or calling customer support.I received an email on Mon, Sep 11, 2023 at 6:26 PM from Paypal informing me that they restored some features, and that they'll proceed with restoring my full account after I provide some documents.As I was uploading the documents and explaining my business, I received another email about an hour later, telling me that the 180 day hold is back again, and my account is fully deactivated, which is very disappointing considering that I've done everything I can to abide by the Paypal policy.I'm still on my word, that I'll do everything I can, and take all the necessary measures to retrieve what's rightfully owned. As I believe this is a matter of discrimination, because I belong to a country (Morocco) with a ""high risk"" in Paypal's views.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review :Reference ID: PP-L-426159964349Paypal unlawfully put a 180 day hold on the money I rightfully earned. I have a legitimate business model in place. I ship to customers in less than 2 days, and I upload the tracking number in less than 24 hours. I only have one single dispute where a client bought and cancelled on the same day claiming that they didn't receive their order. However, Paypal still put the infamous 180 day hold on my account and ignore all my attemps to contact customer support and their higher ups.I'm only urging Paypal to do the right thing and review my case, as I truly believe, that I've done everything by the book, and that my account is flawless as far as policy compliance is concerned.In the event that Paypal reviews my case, I will update this review accordingly no matter the outcome.However, if that's not the case, I will leave no stone unturned, and i'll take all the legal channels to get my rightfully owned money.",3,2023-09-20T07:37:12.000Z,Youssef
Forced currency conversion at crazy rates.,"My complaint to paypal:""...If I have been paid an amount to my Paypal account - Money that has already had a fee deducted before entering my account - I can not withdraw the money without paying a currency conversion rate that has got nothing to do with reality. This basically means that whatever amount is in my Paypal account is not real.The fact that you do not allow transfers to same currency accounts or transfers to credit cards, like you do allow in the US, makes it seem like a dirty business to me. Customers can not avoid your unreal currency conversion rates, no matter what they do.You have made very specific restrictions to make sure that you can earn a lot of money from people's lack of ability to see through complex set of rules and restrictions. The intensity with which you screw over customers far exceeds any other banks and payment services, inlcuding international banks/payment services like Lunar, Revolut, and Wise.Ethically, I would say that your business model in Denmark, and in other EU countries, is questionable. This has made my view of Paypal change very much.My specific issue is that I need to withdraw 7,000 EUR from my account in total. As you do not allow me to transfer the money to a EUR account and do not allow me to transfer to a credit card, I would need to accept a conversion rate from EUR to DKK that is far below the market rate and far below the rate of any other bank.As an example I could mention Revolut. Their rate is 7.44 DKK/EUR against the market rate of 7.45 DKK/EUR, and if converting an amount exceeding 1,000EUR per rolling month with Revolut, there is a 1% fee. Let us say that I want to convert everything at once; The fee will amount to 6,000EUR*1%=60EUR and I would end up with 6,940EUR*7.44=51,633DKK. If I let Paypal do this conversion I would have to accept a rate of 7.227DKK/EUR, which is 3% below the market rate.>This amounts to 7,000EUR*7.227=50,589DKK, which equals 3 times as high a cost than that of Revolut, given that I convert everything at once. - Or 1,044DKK extra, compared to Revolut.With Revolut or Wise I am not forced to convert anything, as I can transfer the Euros directly to another Euro account. This also means that the amount of money in my account reflects very well the actual amount that I can spend, where as it does not in my Paypal account.This constellation seems like quite a trick and I am in doubt whether this would be seen as ethically acceptable by the Danish or European banking authorities.""They replied:""... Here at PayPal we're only able to transfer funds to your local bank account in the local currency of the country that your account is registred in. Since this is account is registred in Denmark you will only be able to send DKK to a Danish bank account, through a normal withdrawal.The reason that there is different things allowed in different countries varies depending on a variety of reasons, such as but not limited to: Regulations, Permission we have, How a fiinancial system works and our _intergreation_ in said market. ...""Yes exactly, the reason is their ""integration"" into the market, where they could easily let customers withdraw to a same currency account. They just choose not to, to earn money on the insane conversion rate that they have.It does not have anything to do with regulation.",1,2023-09-09T10:50:14.000Z,Simon R

Extremely shocking behavior !!!,"After a 41 minute conversation with the customer service representative called Nahoom, I can officially say that I am truly disgusted. From the first second, he was looking for ways to find how this whole this was my fault. He then finds an option I had chosen in the ""contact us"" process/form, which I told him I had just chosen the top option JUST to get to the part where I could write my side of the story as it was Saturday and their phonelines were closed that day, he rushes off to his supervisor and comes back all happy now that he was able to tell me he is NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING! He sounded like a kid on Christmas! The backstory: I order something online, PayPal automatically converted the amount from the original USD to my local currency which ended in an unreasonable amount so I ONLY wanted them to let me use USD or refund me the difference. They automatically again sent me a mail that the WHOLE amount was going to be refunded, so then now the shop SUSPENDED me because it looks like Im a fraud to them, which I cant blame them for. All while PayPal REFUSES to even help me and have people like Nahoom LOOKING for ways to AVOID helping a 15 or 20+ year LOYAL customer. How is that NOT shocking???? Hence the title of this review!! All I asked Nahoom and PayPal was tell the shop what I had wrote to them, that I had NOT asked PayPal for a refund, onøy to switch the currency back WITHOUT PayPal forcing me to use their conversion which ended like 20 USD higher than my bank would convert. Nahoom said no, and said hus Supervisor agreed and that he wont do anything else either. Now I have sent a complaint, asked for another supervisor to call me. Will update this review if I have something to report! Case ending with 494717572.",1,2023-08-28T13:46:26.000Z,Aviator

Unexplained Permanent Limitation Severely Impacted My Business,"I have been a loyal PayPal customer for years, using it for my UK-registered business, FREAKHOSTING, which specializes in Web & Game hosting services. On August 28, 2023, my business account was permanently limited without any clear explanation, causing significant financial strain and loss of reputation.Prior to this, I received an email on August 22, 2023, asking for additional information related to my business. The deadline for this was set for October 6, 2023. I tried to upload the required documents on August 25 and 26 but was met with consistent error messages. I even tried different browsers and incognito mode, but nothing worked.I contacted PayPal Customer Service on August 27 and spoke with a representative named Ailene. She advised me to email the necessary documents for account verification. I did so promptly, and she assured me that the verification team would review the materials and respond by September 1, 2023.Shockingly, just a few hours after my submission, I received an email stating that my account had been permanently limited. I have reached out to PayPal multiple times to resolve this issue but have not received a satisfactory resolution or even a clear reason for the limitation.I understand that PayPal has policies to protect its users, but the lack of transparency and the abrupt action taken against my account without giving me an opportunity to address any concerns is deeply unsettling. I hope that sharing my experience here prompts a thorough review of my case and helps others be aware of the potential issues they may face.",1,2023-08-28T17:09:41.000Z,Vlad Alexandru

The Decline of PayPal: An Urgent Call for Change,"PayPal, once heralded as a pioneer in online payment solutions, has recently come under fire for its alleged negligence, lack of customer support, and reluctance to investigate fraud claims thoroughly. As a longtime user of PayPal, I've had a distressing experience that prompts me to raise serious concerns about the company's ethics and customer commitment. In this article, we will delve into the issues surrounding PayPal's customer service and explore alternative payment options that may offer a more secure and trustworthy experience.1. Customer Service Woes:It's disheartening to witness PayPal's apparent disregard for its customers' concerns. When faced with issues such as fraud or unauthorized transactions, many users report encountering bureaucratic red tape and dismissive responses from PayPal's support team. My personal experience mirrors this sentiment, as I had to persistently pursue my case with clear evidence of fraud before the company took any action.2. Lack of Fraud Investigation:One of the core responsibilities of a payment service provider is to protect its users from fraudulent activities. Unfortunately, PayPal's recent track record in this regard leaves much to be desired. My case, where my signature was forged, highlights PayPal's reluctance to conduct thorough investigations and provide a fair resolution. It was only after my relentless efforts and the merchant's involvement that my money was eventually refunded.3. Exploring Alternatives:Given these troubling issues, it's crucial to consider alternative payment options that prioritize customer satisfaction and security. Several alternatives have emerged in recent years that offer viable alternatives to PayPal:   a. Stripe: Known for its developer-friendly approach, Stripe offers robust fraud prevention tools and transparent pricing.   b. Square: Square provides a range of payment solutions, including in-person and online payments, with a reputation for excellent customer support.   c. TransferWise (now Wise): Wise specializes in international money transfers with competitive exchange rates and transparent fees.   d. Apple Pay and Google Pay: These mobile payment options offer convenient and secure ways to make online and in-store purchases.4. An Appeal to PayPal:In closing, I sincerely urge PayPal to reevaluate its policies and prioritize customer satisfaction and security. The company's current trajectory, marred by allegations of negligence and a lack of transparency, threatens to erode the trust of its user base. As a longtime customer, I believe in the potential for PayPal to once again become a trustworthy payment partner, but swift action is needed to address these issues.PayPal's decline in customer service and fraud investigation has raised serious concerns about its ethics and commitment to its users. It's essential for individuals and businesses to explore alternative payment solutions that prioritize their needs and security. Additionally, I implore PayPal to take immediate steps to rectify these issues before they risk losing more of their loyal customers.",1,2023-09-13T07:44:21.000Z,Dawson L
Review for the Paypal application.,"PayPal is unrivaled when it comes to the ease of making payments online. Users can safely send and receive money with just an email address and an authorized password, eliminating the need to share sensitive financial information with various merchants.Wide Acceptance: Due to its widespread acceptance by online stores and businesses around the world, PayPal is a flexible payment mechanism for a variety of transactions, from purchases to bill payments.Security: PayPal uses robust security measures, including fraud detection systems, encryption technology, and buyer protection programs, to protect users' financial information from unauthorized access.Customer Protection:The PayPal Buyer Protection policy shields customers from potential scams and disputes with merchants. If an approved item doesn't exist or match the description, PayPal could issue a refund.Cellular Payments:The useful on-the-go payment and money transfer features of the mobile app expand PayPal's reach.International Business:Because the software handles the operation automatically, PayPal users may send and receive money internationally without worrying about currency adjustments.Connecting Various Payment Methods:Users who use PayPal can connect their accounts to a variety of financing options, such as credit cards and bank accounts, increasing their financial freedom. At the end i would say online purchases have undoubtedly altered as a result of PayPal, which provides users with unmatched convenience, security, and variety. Due to its wide acceptance and buyer protection strategy, many clients and corporations favor it. Users need to be on the lookout for potential account limits, platform fees, and customer service issues.",4,2023-08-27T17:21:11.000Z,Dr. Umesh Yadav
Unfortunately,"Unfortunately, to a point if I could give them a zero, I would, my account got hacked and a person tried to take $300.

PayPal, because I had not just opened up the case with them. Also, my bank had taken the money that was robbed from me and they robbed me(PayPal) he explained it as if I was the person trying to dupe them and saying I was double dipping, when I was the person that got robbed and got hacked, and seen that it happened I opened up a case and seeing that they didn’t take care of it with another appropriate time noticed that it also went through my bank so I opened up a case with them to be there and be notified by them three weeks later after getting the runaround that because I did that they took the money refunded it to the company that it was coming from and since they paid for it to that company, they expected their money back and took it out of my account a.k.a. PayPal without leaving any transaction notification, saying that they had all rights to do this  and wouldn’t even give me the courtesy of putting down on documentation that this happened only sending me back emails that I have already been given, and all I wanted them to do was to write down. Yes, we took the money, directly from your account, without you agreeing , the representatives were disrespectful, and the higher representatives were functionally unintelligent beings that are drones run by a corporation that over $300. They got butt hurt and couldn’t be able to pay somebody because of a falt on their own security.to finish I am dissatisfied with anything dealing with PayPal. When it comes to their communication, their disrespect, the corporation is a terrible structure on how to show and do a business both worldwide and in your personal environment, I do not recommend talking to customer service without knowing that you will be put on mute, laughed at, belittled, and disrespected, there are other apps affiliate are decent, and I suggest dealing with them on other basis.

He did not care if this issue was solved or not. The last time I called I was sent to an account specialist when I said I was going to get my attorney involved. She was not helpful. The specialist said she was going to have a ticket sent to the department that takes care of these issues. Well, that was two weeks ago. I have not heard from Paypal nor have I seen a check. They have never reached out to me I have always called them. This is ridiculous its an easy issue. I have proved this over and over again my identity.

Behaving appallingly,"made a purchase on Photospecialist.co.ukon 6th August for a Braun digital picture frame. I used PayPal Credit account to pay for this purchase which was meant to be delivered In 3 working days. On the 10th August I got my first message from the courier UPS to say my item would be delivered today between 10.15 and 2.15. No item ever arrived and I have received the same message daily now for the past 15 days. I have contacted the seller who is not interested and blames the courier UPS. UPS stated that customs have the item and it is out of their control and to contact the seller. Paypal refuse to refund my purchase price paid for using PayPal credit facility, stating that as the item is coming from abroad I have to wait 20 days even though I believed I was purchasing from a UK website and my invoice clearly states webshop United Kingdom, PayPal also tell me that each time the seller updates the tracking information this 20 day period is reset back to day zero, it has been updated with a different delivery day every day now for the past 15 days. This situation could just go on and on and on, all the seller has to do is keep updating the tracking information and PayPal tested the clock back to zero again. I have no item, a balance if £158.99 on my PayPal credit account which PayPal tell me I must pay even if I never receive the item. I believe this to be fraudulent conduct.  My consumer rights under the sale of goods act 2015, the UK distance selling regulations etc are being completely ignored by both PayPal and the seller.under UK distance selling regulations I am entitled to cancel the order in the first 14 days without having to give any reason, and obtain a full refund, mindful of this 14 day period I emailed photospecialist on day 12 requesting the order to be cancelled under the 14 day distance selling regulations. I have had no response. Paypal serm to be condoning this sellers unacceptable behaviour. I do not believe I should have to pay a penny for items never received. Paypal tell me there is no buyer protection with PayPal credit even though it is advertised by PayPal as being 'just Like using a credit card without the physical card'. This being the case I should have cover under section 75 if the consumer credit act, but I am getting absolutely know here with PayPal. I asked to close the PayPal credit account as I believe it is a fraudulent facility being offered by PayPal, I was told no you can't as you have an outstanding balance in the account if £158.99 for the digital picture frame u have never received. I asked to close my PayPal account as I had never experienced conduct like this from PayPal in 29 years of being a member, I was told no you can't close your account as you have an outstanding balance in your account. I am being forced to pay for something I have not and may never receive.  This just cannot be right at any level. Experience so far between 6th August and 22nd August.

UPDATE: Resolved Account Access Issue,"UPDATE (August 15th, 2023): I would like to provide an update regarding the previous account access problem I experienced. Initially, I encountered difficulties logging in and accessing my account due to SMS verification. At the time, I believed the issue was on PayPal's end. However, after engaging with several support agents via phone calls, it became apparent that the root cause was with my mobile provider. Unfortunately, their system was not reliably receiving automated PayPal messages, and the cause of this issue remains unknown.To address this, I opted to switch to a new mobile number from a different network. The PayPal support team demonstrated professionalism and assisted me in smoothly updating both my personal and business accounts with the new number. I'm pleased to report that everything is now functioning as intended.Considering this clarification, I am adjusting my review to 4 stars. While the main issue was not directly attributable to PayPal's platform, I recognize that there are still some existing issues and minor inconveniences that could be improved. The support agents' dedication to resolving the problem is commendable, and I acknowledge their efforts.",4,2023-08-15T14:14:08.000Z,Dejan Ilic

Awful,Awful. So so bad. PayPals app somehow jumped to echeck and so when I tried to make a payment to someone it instead did a pending transaction from my bank account to my paypal account that was going to take 10 days. PayPal we’re really patronising and refused to cancel this and said it was ‘obviously’ for my bank to cancel. My bank said not possible and that it was definitely for paypal to cancel. Honestly a nightmare. They won’t even let me delete my account until the transaction is complete… even though it’s a transaction from my nationwide account to my PayPal account… the whole thing is stupid. Why are  companies and their agents so stupid. Furious,1,2023-08-10T14:47:11.000Z,Jane001

Appalling Service from Resolution Centre,"I have been using PayPal for more than 7 years. For straight payments I have found them very good. However if there is a dispute the Resolution Center is an absolute disaster. There is no common sense or logic involved. In my latest problem the service from Resolution Center was appalling. There was never a dispute. PayPal misunderstood the original message from the ""Payer"" and concocted a dispute that had nothing to do with the message sent by ""Payer"". This message just informed PayPal that ""Payee"" had not yet received the money. ""Payer"" never mentioned non-delivery of goods or items. In fact this was purely a monetary transaction where ""Payer"" was refunding part of a payment previously made by ""Payee"" to ""Payer"". PayPal never contacted ""Payer"" but kept on insisting that he was the only party that could close the dispute. On 19th July ""Payee"" received a phone call from PayPal Dublin in Ireland advising ""Payee"" that the dispute had been resolved and that ""Payee"" could expect payment within 72 hours. This of course did not happen. After a month of fruitless messages to the Resolution Center ""Payer"" advised ""Payee"" that the money less charges had been refunded into his account and asked how he should now pay ""Payee"". ""Payee"" has told him try PayPal again and not raise any queries. ""Payee"" now wants to make a formal complaint to higher management at PayPal but this appears to be impossible. PayPal has now charged ""Payee"" USD 8 for dispute charges. Someone tries to pay you, PayPal creates a non-existent dispute, you don't get the payment but end up owing PayPal money.

PayPal is not what it used to be,My experience with PayPal customer services very similar to someone else wrote. They say a lot of things you want to hear but they don't back it up... PayPal is going away downhill.Their online website customer service is all automated.  It's relies on bots to handle situations about your money. A bot can't determine reason or right from wrong. It only knows specific answers and if your situation doesn't fill into a certain box the bot can't handle it. Their Facebook customer service is better that you can get a live person but they're just filled with saying all the right things. They want to sound like Amazon customer service but they fall way short because their actions don't back it up. They say they have buyer protection but you will get the run around if you try to get refund back from a fraudulent seller.  They don't stand by buyers the way Amazon does.

Less than Zero,"Less than zero. Their ""Resolution Center"" is a joke. Their Algo-bot just wastes time until one party finally relents. After weeks of ""resolution"" they want me to get the government involved. Here's my reply:""This is getting a little out of hand here. What I'm asking for is an approximately $85 refund for parts missing in shipment, and shipping fees. That's it, $85. The seller is fighting this, even though they are in the wrong. As far as I know, there haven't been any crimes committed here. I've supplied photos, descriptions, and a tally of costs, everything you need to make an informed decision. Now, you're suggesting that I contact a list of state and Federal agencies, ask them to begin investigations, get official reports, then forward them to PayPal?Really?I ask you, to what end is this, for $85? Your company can't make a wise determination as to what happened here without government intervention? Why are you even involved in this, if you can't make a fair judgement?I demand some real action here, and stop wasting my time. There needs to be a real person from your company handling this. I don't mean some robotic algorithm that stalls and throws roadblocks, until finally one party gives up. A living, breathing, person, with experience and the authority to act on it.Sincerely,Mark""",1,2023-08-03T02:17:37.000Z,Mark R.

"They have lost the plot, completely!",Used the same PayPal account for my seasonal hire business online payments for 10 years but this year has been a disaster. 1) They saw the usual growth in sales in Spring so they put me on Fraud watch!!!!!!!!! Limiting my available funds! I always used the cash flow from sales to reinvest in new stock but didn’t have the opportunity this year because when the funds were finally available we were half way through our peak Summer season.2) When funds finally became available it took 5 days withdrawal to appear on my account - in previous years this was instant!3) session data failed to return to my server after payment for the first time ever! This happened with 10 transactions so my server didn’t know that the payment had been made - This was about an month after being put on fraud watch. We have found alternative payment processors since.,1,2023-08-02T11:41:08.000Z,Ryan Richardson
Appalling Treatment by PayPal - Avoid at All Costs!,"I had the unfortunate experience of being a PayPal customer, and I cannot express enough how terribly disappointed I am with their services. I use account with email ""marvin.franciis@yahoo. PayPal's recent actions have left me frustrated and appalled at their lack of consideration for their customers.First and foremost, without any warning or explanation, PayPal chose to close my account abruptly. As a long-time user, I trusted PayPal to handle my online transactions securely, but this unprofessional behavior shattered that trust entirely. They showed a complete disregard for my loyalty and offered no transparency about their decision.The worst part is their customer service—or lack thereof. Attempting to get answers or assistance from their support team was like banging my head against a wall. They were unresponsive, indifferent, and seemed to have little regard for my concerns. It's evident that PayPal doesn't value its customers or care about the impact their actions have on us.The lack of communication and explanation for the account closure only adds to the frustration. I have every right to know why my account was shut down, but it seems that PayPal thinks they can get away with treating customers like disposable entities.Furthermore, their policies appear to be arbitrary and prone to sudden changes, leaving users vulnerable and uncertain about their funds. The entire experience has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone.In conclusion, my experience with PayPal has been a complete disaster. They have proven themselves to be unprofessional, uncaring, and unreliable. I urge everyone to think twice before entrusting their hard-earned money and personal information to such a company.Steer clear of PayPal and explore other more reputable and customer-oriented payment platforms. They clearly have no regard for their customers' well-being and deserve nothing but disdain for their appalling treatment.Avoid PayPal at all costs!",1,2023-08-02T11:28:58.000Z,Marvin Francis
Never open a business account with…,"Never open a business account with PayPal. I started a business account and made a mistake of getting zettle. After you get settled, you can't close your PayPal account without first closing your zettle account. If you would like to downgrade your business account to a regular account, forget it. It's impossible they tell you they can't. I asked them if I could cancel my account just close it. They said no. You have to talk to zettle first then we can close your account. So basically I'm stuck with an account I don't need and don't want for the rest of my life or at least until zettle answers their freaking phone. Never ever even think about starting a business account with these fools. If you do, it's your own problem. I warned you",1,2023-08-01T18:38:32.000Z,Kevin Bailey

I prepaid for a rental car with avis…,"I prepaid for a rental car with avis using paypal. avis told me they cannot accept paypal as a payment method because there is no card number to check the last 4 digits on. So the day of vacation avis charged me the full rental amount, plus deposit. After I had already paid in full and should have had a $300 hold on my credit card. So now I have an authorization and have already paid a total of $1,049. This is day 1 of my vacation. I ask for my money back from avis and paypal. Neither company will look at it or try to resolve anything in anyway. I am quite upset at this point. But hey everyone going on vacation with a family of 4 has multiple extra thousands of dollars available to go with right? I end the vacation 1 day early. Lose the money paid for prepayment on the days activites. $260 gone. Come back home and return the car 1 day early. So a total of 6 days. I call avis and they are barely willing to refund me for the day I returned the car early. Only after arguing with the phone representitive for 20 minutes. Now 4 hours on the phone with paypal the superviser named Ron finally looks at the request. He told me for 5 minutes or more that it was not possible to close out the case today.

I have a PERSONAL account on PayPal. I have $69 in my account to take care of my daughter on and to make it by with, to buy food and diapers for her and gas for my car. I get on there and it says that PayPal has permanently limited my account! I do not make buyer seller transactions whatsoever nothing but private transactions between friends and family. You would think that I would be some big ringleader of something according to them with my little bit of student loan money that I get! HA! Then they can't seem to tell me why my account has been done this way! Well I am absolutely positively 1,000% sure that there is no way I violated any of their terms! I've never had a transaction on there over $500 not one time. How this place has a A+ rating with the BBB is way beyond me, but since that right there is the case they are supposed to offer transparency and be transparent with its customers which they know nothing about. Customer service is terrible you can't even understand what they're saying to you. Nor do they ever understand what you're saying to them either. Look up and see how many class action lawsuits an individual lawsuit has been brought against them for this! MANY! SO NOW THANKS TO THEM KEEPING MY BIG $69, I have to struggle some more trying to come up with a way to get that money back so I'm able to take care of my 2-year-old daughter and that's a lot of money to us it might not be to everybody else but it is to us. I had just enough money to make it through until I got my next loan deposit.

Non-existence method to alert a faulty item and request a refund,"I bought a specialist item from a vendor in Vietnam and chose to pay by Paypal in case anything went wrong. The item that was sent to me was faulty and when I tried to log the fault with Paypal, an error message repeatedly showed. This occurred both with the app and with the online website. When I wrote to Paypal about this, they did nothing. The deadline for logging an issue expired and I was left with no recourse.

PayPal is a conduit for fraud,It is not surprising that 87% of reviews have a 1 star rating.PayPal sent US$ 725.72 and US$ 125.99  by money transfer to a fraudster known to PayPal without my authorization taking £576.00 and £100.00 from my UK Bank account linked to my PayPal account.I have never used money transfer and certainly not in US$ in more than 10 years as a PayPal customer yet these transactions were not identified by PayPal as suspicious requiring verification. A case was opened by me and closed as PayPal said the transactions were authorized.  My Bank then instigated 2 cases with PayPal which are currently under review awaiting response from third party. My Bank advise that they cannot assist as my PayPal account is linked to them. The transactions between PayPal and my Bank are therefore authorized. I am unable to close my PayPal account while these case are still open. I am unable to un-link my Bank details with PayPal so I have advised my Bank directly that no further transactions should be made to PayPal.Although I have raised a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service in the UK it would appear that PayPal is not regulated in the UK as a Bank.All UK users of PayPal need to be aware that PayPal enables Fraud and there is little chance of them being able to recover the proceeds of crime.,1,2023-07-27T10:52:13.000Z,Alan Sambrook
Lack of support,"Hi all, I approached PayPal for some support after returning items to Shein, which had got lost in the post, hmmm. I sent proof of postage, tracking number and date the items were sent back, (June) couldn’t be any clearer, you think! Well I opened a case against Shein as was unable to contact them. Well I was requested to send these items back, hmmm which had already been returned, doesn’t make sense I know!! Even after sending all this hard evidence, photos, copies of return, explanation on why I couldn’t resend items already returned PayPal ruled in Sheins favour!!! Really, so now I’m out of pocket to the sum of £43.  So please understand that PayPal are not always supportive.

I've encountered 2 issues with 3rd Party websites, that were overseas scams,  but paypal couldn't get it no matter how many times I explained, how many times I sent reputable screen prints stating the site was a scam and after weeks of working with them, they deny your claim because these companies have paypal figured out but paypal hasn't a clue.

Bad service,"In 2017, I created my PayPal account, which was two years before turning 18. Recently, I legally changed my name and requested to update it on my PayPal account. Unfortunately, I was met with disappointment as PayPal informed me that I could no longer use their services because I had created the account before I turned 18. This experience has left me frustrated and disappointed with PayPal. I reached out to their customer service, but it seemed like there was no way to resolve the issue or delete my account information.I strongly advise against using PayPal due to their inflexibility and lack of understanding in such situations. They seem to categorize anyone who created an account before they turned 18 as a potential scammer, which is unfair and unjust. Despite growing older and providing all the necessary legal documentation, they still treated me as if I were underage. This attitude is not only irrelevant but also discriminatory.I wish PayPal had a better system in place to handle cases like mine, where people have genuinely changed and improved over the years. Their refusal to work with me has left me feeling frustrated and helpless. Creating a new account is not a practical solution, as it would mean starting from scratch on multiple platforms.Overall, I hope PayPal reevaluates their policies and becomes more understanding and accommodating to their users' needs. Until then, I cannot recommend PayPal as a reliable payment option.",1,2023-07-24T14:02:52.000Z,Anonnymt

Paypal steals money,"I needed money for my service to a company I work with to be delivered faster as the bank transfer would take five days (with the weekend). We've made a huge mistake and used Paypal to process that payment. And to our surprise, they have put that money on hold for 21 days! For no reason at all. There is nothing that can be done to release it earlier and this is the money I badly need as I just bought a new home. I've just spent 2,5 hrs with their support chat, which was completely useless, unhelpful and who kept contradicting their own advice - I went nowhere with that. So, they not only stole my money and left me with nothing but had no problem charging me 5% of the transaction. In the end, I was advised that 'Well, you'll have to wait 21 days'. Easy to say for such a loaded corporation. Self-employed contractors can't afford to wait almost a month for their money, because Paypal wants to do some dodgy stuff for 21 days with MY money! Moreover, I enquired about me refunding the company the money so they can just transfer it via bank. Thier reply? It takes 5 working days, but for some cards/banks it may be 30... Oh, and they will keep the 5% charge after the refund. So, AVOID by all means. I  never liked Paypal, and hardly used it, but now, as soon as this payment comes through I am cancelling my account with these thieves.

Fraud is happening,"PayPal gave me a link to a Representatives to discuss a payment that coming out of my bank, unauthorized! fraud even though the bank card is not linked with PayPal but I've used it a few times on eBay, A unrecognised name WITECWINTE a payment of £13.40, is pending,  PayPal which I phoned is investigating this, they found the name page ect,  but the messages from the representatives, are useless, saying how did you know about this if you didn't get a email, without  a linked card,  over and over I emphasize in so many messages but still they don't get it, I had a bank alert that's how I knew, I wouldn't get a fake email from a fake person setting up a PayPal account with my card would I !!!! but I am amazed that PayPal have allowed this to be a accepted payment, when my name and my other card is linked with them, how can this happen, plus at the same time this PayPal went through, someone was trying get a payment out of my bank under the name Kickstarter.com, anyone heard of this, this is disgusting from PayPal, I e been with them since eBay 2006, and spent a lot, for them to doubt me, fraud is happening. Update 20th/07, PayPal has closed my case, supposedly getting a refund, but, no explanation! no sorry!  Or how this happened! eBay or PayPal to blame? Money still came out of my bank, and some how this payment was a donation to which I can't give the email, sloppy service, I am very lucky that it wasn't a thousand pounds coming out, because reporting this to PayPal, hasn't been easy, and the bank didn't stop the payment coming out, I am not confident with PayPal eBay or the bank.",1,2023-07-20T14:46:38.000Z,The police
Constant issues with transaction going wrong.,"Service is easy to use and send money to, but it takes forever for ANY information to reach my bank, causing a few issues. On top of that, Paypal comstantly makes mistakes, like charging the wrong account, charging the wrong amount, or not turning a transaction into a Pay in 4 Plan, resulting in the full amount being charged. Whenever this happens, they can never help. They always say they can't fix their own mistakes. That it has to be done through the merchant, even though THEY were the ones who screwed up.Just recently, I planned my spending around a convention I'm going to this weekend.Bought a pair of kits from E2046 during a sale, two kits going out of stock, one really rare, and the other would take months at the least for the mext batch to be ready. I applied for a Pay in 4. Paypal told me what the price for each payment would be, said the application was successful, and everything should have gone through. The pay in 4 was never started, and the ENTIRE transaction went through, thoroughly screwing me over. What would have been a good $150 for personal spending and gas at this comvention is now a NEGATIVE BALANCE, and Paypal says they can't do anything about it, and I have to contact the merchant(who, by the way, is in a conpletely different timezone that me) to cancel my order of rare GKs and take the 10% cancellation fee.  Thanks a lot, Paypal, for always messing up and never fixing it.",2,2023-07-19T22:20:20.000Z,Katherine Watson
PayPal Holds Money for Their Benefit,"Obviously PayPal find reasons to hold payments from invoices because they want to keep money in their bank accounts for longer. Preserving their cash flow and treating your business like a free credit provider is their aim here.They put a limit if a measly 2,300 per month to justify holding close to 1,600 of the money my clients paid for services I already rendered. No matter how many times I tried to explain to them that I don’t ship anything so there’s no need to hold money, they kept insisting that due to increased sales I have a limit of under 2,500 per month. I closed all Vemo any other accounts ran by PayPal because of the obvious trickery in justifying holding money for 21 days. They don’t care that the money is your source of income from self employment or small business services eitherThen the customer service agents lied about putting in a ticket after agreeing my money shouldn’t be held.",1,2023-07-19T22:14:14.000Z,Kweli Vuur

I am a director of Airgon Technologies…,"I am a director of Airgon Technologies and I cannot believe that this business is still trading and why arent they being investigated by the FCA? We have a transactional website called Airgon.co.uk that had (past tense) a PayPal link to enable people to pay using PayPal for added security.  Firstly the process for signing up was back to front with poor programming so we couldn't complete our account opening and after nearly 3 months still haven't. We spend hours every week literally trying to resolve this with 1 CSR who went on holiday and -no one TOOK OVER HIS CASES . Then they withheld payments which at £249 a pop wasn't appreciated and we had no way of getting our money released.  We then get a series of the same automated emails telling us the same thing which we couldn't action because of the way THEY are set up, but importantly telling us; as we were a new customer, they hold our money for 21 days as a ""Security measure"".  We were NEVER informed of this or we would not have gone with them, they already took their £7.22 per transaction whilst getting interest on the money they held.  we project 2,000 transactions each month work it out... I will never use PayPal again as a merchant because they are verging on fraudulent, definitely Incompetent and judging from the Score of TP most definately have NO customer centricity to the extent they are UNPROFESSIONAL, our Verdict is AVOID.",1,2023-07-19T19:49:50.000Z,Mark Brown

PayPal not protecting from fraud,"Payed 8$ for an IQ test, and few days later I was charged 80$ on my PayPal account. While paying 8$ I signed up for subscription with 7 days trial, because there is no way to get the results otherwise. As soon as I got them, I went on their web site to cancel the subscription, but they do not offer that possibility. So I sent them an email stating I want it canceled I refuse to pay more money. It was 2 minutes into my subscription. They did't respond.I went to PayPal's resolution center and filed a dispute. This was 6 days ago. Still waiting for PayPal's reaction. I added a lot of additional info, such as bank statement, Brainety invoice, PayPal notification of charging.Later I found out many people got scammed by this f****** page.Hope I'll get my money back.UPDATE 17.7.Brainety asked for additional info on my review, maybe they do pay me back my money seeing I tried to cancel subscription via email, but they ignored it.Will post an update in either case.19. 7.

Decent Payment Processing with Room for Improvement,"PayPal has established itself as a widely recognized and convenient payment solution, but it has its fair share of shortcomings. While it offers some benefits, there are aspects of PayPal that could be improved upon.One of the notable advantages of using PayPal is its widespread acceptance. Many online merchants and service providers support PayPal as a payment method, making it a convenient option for customers. The user interface is generally straightforward, making it easy to send and receive payments, and the ability to link bank accounts and credit cards provides flexibility in funding sources.However, PayPal's fees can be quite high, especially for certain types of transactions. The fee structure can be complex to understand, and it's important for users to carefully review the associated costs. Additionally, when it comes to currency conversion, PayPal's exchange rates are often less favorable compared to other alternatives, leading to potential financial losses for international transactions.Another drawback is PayPal's customer support, which is known for being inconsistent. While some users have reported positive experiences, others have faced challenges when trying to resolve issues. The response times can vary, and the overall support experience may not always meet expectations.PayPal's dispute resolution process can also be frustrating for users. While it offers protection against unauthorized transactions and buyer/seller disputes, the resolution process can be lengthy and complex. This can result in delays and potential frustrations for those seeking resolution for payment-related problems.Furthermore, PayPal's account limitations and occasional freezes are known to cause inconvenience for users. These restrictions can be imposed with little to no explanation, leaving users without access to their funds and requiring additional steps to resolve the issue.In conclusion, PayPal is a widely accepted and convenient payment solution, but it falls short in several areas. The high fees, unfavorable currency conversion rates, inconsistent customer support, and occasional account limitations detract from the overall user experience. While it remains a popular choice for many, PayPal could benefit from addressing these concerns to provide a more reliable and user-friendly payment service.",3,2023-07-15T02:43:25.000Z,Lynlee

Consumer Beware!!,"I have never in my life dealt with a company who defrauds their own members..

What???After repeated attempts to find out how this can be corrected, they basically told me they could do nothing to help in an effort to protect other members?? What???I also asked to close my account since it was obviously hacked.. They said I could not close my account.. When I check my account online, I cannot access any of my personal data unless I complete my business information..I DO NOT HAVE A BUSINESS!!!!!!!Now I am beginning to see charges to my bank accounts and credit cards from whoever hacked into my account???Apparently the hacker can use my account, but I cannot??This tells me that PayPal is keeping my compromised account open so the hackers can steal money from me...

Closed business accounts with no valid reason,"I was travelling with my wife and dogs when I get an email that says ""You can no longer use paypal"". The email was very generic and basically just said that my account is limited permanently. Mind you, this is a 3 year old business account for my website that makes between $80-120 a day, every day for the last 3 years with very few issues or chargebacks. When I called to ask why, the lady who ""helped"" me said that it was flagged by some kind of algorithm, and that she would have it ""looked into"" and when I asked WHY the account was closed she said that her team has no access to that information and then followed that up with ""sometimes in life, these things happen and we just have to move on"".  Nice customer service, right?. So my account is blocked and they have $1200 of MY money in there. Fast forward to mid-May and I get another email from them, this time it's to inform me that they closed another of my business accounts that I have had since the early 2000s.

Bad Business Practices,"The fees are ridiculous with options like cash app & Apple Pay. This led me to the conclusion that I needed to end my relationship with PayPal and close my accounts. First, you cannot truly manage your savings account from the app. This meant dealing directly with their “Customer Service”. After several of their attempts to close the savings account spanning more than a month, they tell me that there is a glitch with a lot of accounts that prevent even PayPal itself from closing the account, and apparently I had one of them! I advised them of my legal rights (after a few of their attempts, I spoke with a finance attorney), and demanded that they close the account immediately or I’d notify my state finance regulatory agency of their denial of my legal right to close it. Somehow, they get as if they had closed the savings account, and even sent me a email stating that it was closed, even though it was NOT. They were still stalling me and trying to talk me out of closing the account. On my next call, they said that my savings account was still open (surprise!), even after they had sent me the email stating that it had been closed. So the next morning, I contacted my state financial regulatory agency, or “banking comptroller”. This was two days ago. Today, I check the app and I am magically able to delete the entire account. In short, PayPal is an overpriced roach-motel. It’s VERY hard to get away from them once you figure out how much they have been taking advantage of you. I recommend staying away from PayPal altogether. “Bad Business Practices” is very much an understatement.",1,2023-07-08T19:06:56.000Z,Matt R

When I tried to file a claim with paypal they are telling me they are not responsible since it was a personal transfer to a friend or family..  that’s not true since I don’t know the person and when following the prompts never saw that I was making a personal transfer or else.. great way for paypal to get rid of customers without helping solve the matter.,1,2023-07-05T18:37:05.000Z,ZS

DO NOT USE PAYPAL!!!,"DO NOT USE THEM, CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRENDOUS!!!I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and frustration with the abysmal customer service provided by PayPal, and to raise awareness about their complete disregard for customer needs and rights. My recent experience with PayPal has left me convinced that they are clueless when it comes to understanding the importance of resolving customer issues and taking responsibility for their mistakes.To provide some context, I encountered a significant problem while using PayPal's services, resulting in a loss of $1,000. However, rather than taking ownership of the issue and making genuine efforts to rectify the situation, PayPal has continually shifted blame onto me, the customer, exacerbating the problem and leaving me feeling utterly disheartened.Adding insult to injury, during my attempts to seek assistance from PayPal's customer service, I was met with extreme lack of professionalism and respect. Not only did they fail to provide any helpful resolution, but they also had the audacity to hang up on me mid-conversation. This blatant disregard for basic customer courtesy and the outright dismissal of my concerns only further emphasizes their lack of accountability and utter apathy towards their clientele.Furthermore, PayPal's indifference towards customer needs is alarming. They appear to have a preconceived notion that their reputation alone is enough to retain customers, neglecting the essential aspect of catering to their clients' concerns. The dismissive attitude exhibited by PayPal's customer service team is deeply concerning and raises questions about their commitment to customer satisfaction.As a result of this unfortunate experience, I have lost a substantial amount of money due to PayPal's failure to address the issue promptly and appropriately. It is exasperating to realize that I am left shouldering the burden of their mistake while they demonstrate a complete lack of empathy and understanding.In light of this distressing encounter, I am compelled to share my disappointment and warn others about the subpar service provided by PayPal. I firmly believe that no one should endure such a frustrating experience when there are numerous alternative services available, which not only offer superior customer support but also prioritize the well-being and satisfaction of their clients.I sincerely hope that by bringing attention to my ordeal, Google can serve as a platform to encourage PayPal to reflect on their practices, reassess their customer service policies, and take the necessary steps to rectify their shortcomings. It is imperative that companies like PayPal recognize the significance of valuing their customers and diligently work towards fostering positive experiences.Keep the manpower in the United States, where at least there is more competent people to deal with. I was on the phone for a total of over 3 hours with multiple useless paypal representatives, getting disconnected three times with no one calling me back, like I can get the same person.  Truly pathetic... They still not refund the $1000.00 dollars they owe me. They are truly not worth your time. Do not use them ever.",1,2023-07-04T23:55:46.000Z,Vinh Taylor

Paypoo are only working on the carrier's claim that it was delivered and are not interested in the proof photograph actually proving  that the driver is not telling the truth! I know that it's not the sellers fault but it is their responsibility to correct it! Telling me to deal with the carrier myself or get them to give me a written confirmation that it wasn't actually delivered is a dreadful response from PayPal and in no way supports their claim to be a safe method of payment for the buyer.

PayPal is absolute scam. Blocking without reason.,"PayPal is absolute scam. I registered just for getting money from my friend from abroad. He sent test sum 5eur. I withdraw it to my card. Then he sent 95eur, system asked for verification.Ok. I sent all documents needed (passport, bill from my bank, bill for electricity with my address). After 1 hour my account got blocked ""permamently"". I began writing to support. Received just a template replies about nothing ""sorry for inconvenience, blablabla..."" Then I call to live support. They found out that my account was blocked automatically ""for any case"". I asked to appeal this decision. They pass over my case to other department but they did not restored account. Now my account blocked forever without any reason. Money freezed. Even sender cannot get it back. This is worst experience using financial platforms. Even cryptoplatforms is much convenient and client friendly than PayPal. I am not reccommend use it.",1,2023-06-30T15:38:43.000Z,Alex Zhossan

Too many rip-offs,Receiving payments into PayPal in another currency is a terrible rip off. First PayPal take a cut and then they give you a shockingly bad exchange rate. To cap it all off they offer to transfer the money out of PayPal and into your bank account either quickly (at a fee) or slowly (for free). People need to do bank transfers these days and just avoid them where possible. I worked out that a €190 payment I received was worth only €174 after the various ripoffs built in to the PayPal system.,2,2023-06-29T13:04:48.000Z,Ian

BEWARE more scamming online,-0 as far as I’m concerned.  I will never deal with this company again. I had. Real bad dispute with eBay and only found out that PayPal and eBay are one of the same know I know why Amazon a professional company did not deal with them got my answer now.  As has been said very poor investigation in fact to me there was none or could I say a scam. Made to feel like a criminal by both companies. BEWARE PayPal are leaving Britain this year and using another named Norwegian company  called Zettel to run the name behind the scenes I wonder why as I see so many accounts not getting dealt with. I was cut off totally no phone contact nothing. I am discussed by the company attitude never had any problems with them till eBay. I do not recommend dealing with them as it’s looks like everyone is getting treated in the same manner. I never had a limitation on my account till I needed to get help. These companies just do what they like  when they like bad business. I hope everyone reports them as I have contacted the police on this matter and believe more should as they need to be stopped they are the ones with masks,1,2023-06-27T12:29:58.000Z,Angel
"When it works it works fine, when it doesn't you can't do anything about it.","Used PayPal for many years, a lot of money in and out, even used pay in 3, today money got stuck in my account, only £13.59 but it's the principle, tried chat support, crashed the app, tried calling, call bot was useless, so ended up doing my usual trick of just not saying anything and then declining any options given until it sends me to a person.The guy was nice enough, tried his best to help, even called back when the call dropped, but from his end he saw no problems, so to summarise, money is stuck (in other cases could be into the thousands in my case only £13.59) and the reason it's stuck is not known by me nor their own customer service.That alone should tell you not to ever trust them with any amount of money, the company is also not very reputable, lost respect for them entirely after the policy change that added ""spreading misinformation on the platform would be subject to a $2,500 fine"", Truly dystopian.I'd suggest avoiding using PayPal at all, period.",1,2023-06-27T11:12:22.000Z,Joe

They are just too big and too stupid to be a good company anymore. One day, we will hear about their downfall. For now, they still enjoy some kind of market ""monopoly"", but just like the old banking system is falling in profit of fintechs, crypto and other 2.0 banking systems, Paypal will fall prey to newcomers that bring back humanity and good practices to this sector. By the way, the APP/Website are super buggy, the support is mediocre. They really just live on their customer base, but that will definitely change.If you had the same experience with this ""thing called a company"", do not hesitate to warn others on other review platforms like GetApp, G2 and Capterra.",1,2023-06-27T09:01:52.000Z,Anas Darif

I was on the phone for HOURS. Being bounced around from one person to another, I've spoken to almost everyone of their staff. I had to re-explain the situation to every new person I was passed off to. They Basically told me, I'm sh-t out of luck and I have to pay the negative balance.

PayPal tries to tell me that there are people didn't find any fraudulent activity but my thing is is how do they know whether or not that was me or not I was the one in jail not them so I know it wasn't me that made the purchases or exchanges I honestly believe this is a case of discrimination cuz it seems like every time I have an account with PayPal my account is flagged for absolutely no reason and now this PayPal will not work with me so I told them they can just shut my account because I'm not paying something I didn't do simple as that,1,2023-06-21T15:12:18.000Z,Tanya R

"I haven't has issues with PayPal, personally","This review covers my whole experience of using PayPal so far. I've used it to pay for lots of things, as well as to receive payments for lots of small items I sold on eBay. I'm in the UK, and it's super handy for buying things in Euros or US$ without paying a conversion fee. I had a big issue a few years back, when a Booking.com payment became hotly disputed. Basically, some random is passing her spare bedroom off as a hotel and claiming guests check out the day after the ""stay"" begins, then she refuses to pay back anything. It was really not as advertised. I had paid for months in advance, so this was a lot of money. Booking.com were being completely unprofessional and strange about it, but PayPal were having absolutely none of it and awarded me the full amount. So, obviously I'm happy about that!!!",5,2023-06-18T14:47:26.000Z,Rosslyn C.

Amy speaks on YTube about being a sex worker a lot. It's clearly on her website under ""appointment"" so is Venmo which is also owned by PayPal. I will continue to speak on this.I have reported this and emailed Dan Schulman CEO of PayPal and customer service and no one does anything about it. They don't care. Maybe Dan is paying Amy too for services? However, I have been told those kinds of services are not allowed to be used with PayPal, but it seems certain hookers are favored.

Had me running around like a headless chicken for nothing because nobody sorted it.I’m at a loss as to why, given that this has happened a lot more so recently, they don’t have procedures to restore the balance quickly and I find it incredibly stupid that both parties state they are not able to directly contact the other. I have to wait up to 7 days and may very well not be able to buy the tickets if they’ve sold out by then.

Later the business support team was cancelled. This is the same situation a colleague of mine had and they move well over $3M a year with Paypal.As a consumer they have been closing cases ahead of the schedule when a company has not delivered what they promised. The Paypal site times out the login before chat support responds (useless support feature) and phone support is really difficult to contact with long waits.Access to Paypal Marketplace is some sort of club you need to know someone to get into to.

A combination of evil and incompetent,"Paypal has wasted hours of my time trying to resolve problems with its dysfunctional website and my account.  At the end of last year, several fraudulent charges appeared on my Paypal World Mastercard; I was able to have them reversed and a new card issued, but they reappeared for months on end online (though not on my monthly statements) -- several long calls to customer service failed to resolve the problem.  This month, I noticed that although I had elected to autopay my credit card balance using my Paypal balance, Paypal had debited my bank account for the full amount instead.  I called Paypal customer service and after a considerable hold, spoke to an agent, who immediately transferred my call to Synchrony Bank (which handles Paypal's World Mastercard); after a difficult exchange with its automated system (it's like pulling wisdom teeth to get through to an agent) and another long wait on hold, I spoke to an agent, who did her utmost to fend me off and transfer me back to Paypal.  Upon being informed that Paypal had transferred my call to Synchrony to resolve, she finally contacted Paypal customer service herself.  After another interminable wait and about an hour on the phone, she came back on to tell me (circuitously) that because the statement balance on my Paypal Mastercard exceeded my Paypal balance, the entire amount had been taken from my bank account, i.e. Paypal has an undisclosed and counterintuitive autopay policy that disregards my autopay choices and necessitates making manual payments in order to use my Paypal balance to pay down my Paypal Mastercard statement balance.  I think that any reasonable person would expect the opposite from what Paypal says on its website (i.e. that I had elected to pay my statement balance using my Paypal balance first and use my bank account as a backup payment source).  Paypal offers me .5% more back on purchases than my other credit cards, but it has cost me many hours of time in dealing with its lack of security, defective website, and undisclosed, inappropriate policies.  The next time, I'm closing my account.",1,2023-06-15T20:28:38.000Z,Robert Chase

The problem I have is one or the other is/was trying to scam me. I want to know which it was so I can ban them. So far ebay says it was PayPal doing the scamming.

I verified with a rep on the phone that this was BS)Reason 4: I had someone repair the guitar (uh, what? This is bogus and not true)I called back, again, and reopened the case, but the whole process is just starting over again, with little hope for me I fear.

Use of Firefox,So I have a business that uses PayPal as a payment gateway for customers. I have had a number of complaints from Customers using Firefox that PayPal just doesn't work for them. I cannot force them to use Google Chrome for goodness sake. They told me they couldn't be bothered to download Google Chrome and so gave up on the purchase.

"TOOK MY MONEY, EVEN THOUGH THE CREDIT WAS DECLINED","I was buying a large item, over £600 in value. At checkout, I was offered 3x interest-free payment credit from PayPal, which seemed a really good deal. So, I clicked apply but the credit was declined. So I bought the item directly with my bank card instead. However, when I looked at my bank account later, it turns out that PayPal had actually now taken the first payment of the declined credit arrangement. So, I had paid for the item on my bank card but despite being declined for the interest free credit by PayPal, they started taking the money anyway and I now expect another 2 payments to be taken from my account over the next 2 months, meaning I have paid twice for the item. I rang my bank and they said there is nothing they can do and that I need to contact PayPal. I am still on hold now but my bank says that it usually takes 7-10 days to get the money back.",1,2023-06-12T13:09:55.000Z,Ian B

A Disappointing Experience with PayPal,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of using PayPal for my online transactions, and I must say that I am thoroughly disappointed with their service. Here's why:Poor Customer Support: Dealing with PayPal's customer support was an absolute nightmare. Whenever I encountered an issue or had a question, it seemed nearly impossible to get a timely response or any meaningful assistance. Their representatives seemed disinterested and provided generic, unhelpful responses.Frequent Account Freezes: PayPal has a reputation for freezing accounts without warning or explanation, and I unfortunately fell victim to this. It was incredibly frustrating to have my funds inaccessible for days on end, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience. The lack of transparency regarding their account suspension policies is deeply concerning.Excessive Fees: PayPal's fees are exorbitant, especially when it comes to receiving payments from overseas or converting currencies. They seem to take advantage of their dominant position in the market by imposing unfair charges, significantly impacting the amount of money received.Inconsistent Security Measures: While PayPal claims to prioritize security, I found their security measures to be inconsistent and unreliable. On several occasions, I received notifications of suspicious activity or potential fraud, only to find out that they had allowed unauthorized transactions to go through without any prompt action or preventive measures.Limited Seller Protection: As a seller, I expected PayPal to offer robust protection against fraudulent buyers. However, I was sorely disappointed when a buyer filed a false claim, and PayPal sided with them without thoroughly investigating the matter. This lack of support for sellers undermines trust and creates an unfavorable environment for conducting business.In conclusion, my experience with PayPal has been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing. Their subpar customer support, arbitrary account freezes, excessive fees, inconsistent security measures, and limited seller protection have left me with a negative impression. I would strongly advise exploring alternative payment platforms that prioritize transparency, fair fees, and reliable customer service.",1,2023-06-11T15:02:15.000Z,Liam Rubbo

Lost trust with PayPal,"I have been with Paypal for many years and recently moved address, I changed my address on Paypal but to my amazement I received 5x declines on orders I made as the change of address for the billing needed changing to.  I called Paypal who rectified the problem and assured they would delete my old address completely.  I then went on to order a few goods which arrived and was purchased fine at my new address. I then made a large order of blinds over £500 which again arrived fine but the colour was wrong the blind's company advised they would change for the cost of £73.70 which I paid for again through Paypal and with it previously arriving fine the first time and with Paypal stating only my new address was on my account and with me only seeing this on my account I did not expect the second transaction to default to my old address, I now live 300 miles away and the blinds were 239cm long 6x in total there was no way I could fit these in a normal car so had to result to getting a courier service £280 to get them to my house.  I spoke with Paypal they said there was hidden addresses that only they could see which their system defaulted to but they could not help me, so basically it's my fault.  I did checks and there is 4x pages long of complaints about this and still it's not their fault?? I have totally lost trust with Paypal and will not be recommending them to anyone.  I'm disgusted that I trusted their word and the fact my account only showed my address but still there was hidden addresses that they defaulted to.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! It's a scummy business that will try everything to take money from your pocket. If you want buyer protection use a credit card!I used to swear by PayPal but not anymore. So far this year I have raised 2 disputes with sellers and PayPals responses have been absolutely shockingDispute 1I purchased a jacket but when it arrived it was covered in mold, I tried contacting the seller to set up a return and had no response so I then reached out to PayPal who after waiting 5 weeks said to return the item to the seller to get a refund. After returning I heard nothing and had no contact until 3 weeks later when PayPal said they would not be giving me a refund as ""the return never arrived"". I checked the tracking and could see the item was successfully delivered to the correct address and signed for by the seller. I spend hours trying to get in contact with a real person and then spent a further 30 minutes pleading my case to someone who was just reading generic responses from a script. Luckily in the end I was able to speak to another person who understand what had happened and agreed I should get a refund. So after nearly 2 months, I was refunded the £210 I spent on the jacket.Dispute 2 (This dispute is currently on going).I purchased some trousers from a seller who later in the week decided to cancel the order and issue a refund. After waiting 9 days for the refund to process, PayPal email me and to say the refund was unsuccessful and they will get in contact with the seller to sort the issue.I then contacted the seller who said PayPal had not reached out to them and I should open a dispute in order to get a refund as they were not sure why the first refund had been canceled.After opening a dispute and adding screenshots of the seller saying I should open one to get a refund they closed the claim in favour of the seller as ""A refund had already been processed"" No, a refund had not been processed, a refund had been started and subsequently canceled by PayPal.I've tried messaging and calling but all I get are bots.This is extremely disappointing as PayPal was always a brand I trusted, I've been using it for 10 years and would always recommend it but not anymore.",1,2023-06-09T20:14:59.000Z,Customer
Always compare total dissatisfied users to total users in general...,"It is definitely frustrating when you feel you’ve done nothing wrong and are nevertheless penalized.  But again, you can’t use anger or individual anecdotes as proof of a company’s worthiness because most people only post anecdotes or complaints when they’ve had bad experiences.  So if you see 90 negative posts out of 100 total it looks like 90% were dissatisfied or even scammed which is not the case.  It could be that the 0.01% dissatisfied customers are the ones that post 90% of the posts.  Instead do some research into statistics of how many use PayPal successfully vs. how many users are dissatisfied of all TOTAL USERS.While it is concerning to read, I still say one’s own experience is the best gauge.  We have been running a business (multiple in the past but just one now) on PayPal for decades and we keep balances well into the five-figure range (sometimes approaching six figures).  We’ve never had any significant issues and we perform an average of two transactions every single day (some days none, other days six or seven transactions).  The only issue I personally had was on my personal (not business) PayPal account where many years ago all these automated withdrawals were happening per second (obviously a computer program) and draining my PayPal balance and then my linked bank account.  Of course this was scary as hell but they immediately reached out, helped me resolve it and restored all my funds.  That was the last significant issue.  Other than that the only issue is certain rules and fee changes that can be frustrating or not in my favor, but nothing significant.Keep in mind, we use PayPal as a bank as well.  We hold funds there for our business until ready to dole them out to the appropriate parties.  It is a holding place for us as well as a way for us to take credit card payments by phone with no monthly terminal rental or even service fee.  Many of our platforms that process payments on our behalf will issue our business payouts via PayPal as well.  We do unlimited transfers of funds to and from our linked bank accounts with never any fees and there are few online services that can do all that, as well as enable you to set up recurring payments and bills, website checkout pages for a business or even event ticket sales with intricate options and pull-down menus (such as for a high school reunion or charity event).It is more versatile and does a LOT more than just allow you to make payments for purchase online, more so than most any of their competitors.",5,2023-06-09T19:58:40.000Z,SWLinPHX

"Report PayPal to CFPB, FTC, Attorney State General","If you are having issues with PayPal, report them to the BBB, CFPB, State Attorney General, and FTC. If enough people report them, maybe something can change.If you value purchase protection and a reliable place to hold your funds, do NOT use PayPal. It's a company full of disgusting scammers, liars, and incompetent representatives. They will find loopholes in your purchase protection to side with Chinese scammers. They only care about making interest off your hard earned money. I hope karma strikes this company and the individuals who participate in this BS hard!!I will continue to give them hell until I get my full refund.UPDATE:I genuinely cannot stand this fraudulent company. Yesterday, I received notification from ScamPal that my remaining cases were denied and closed in the seller's favor because of invalid tracking information. I shipped the counterfeit items back to Chinese scammers on June 5th. When I checked the tracking information, the items are currently held in Nanjing, China. The tracking info provided was either fraudulent or there is a genuine holdup in customs. If the tracking information is invalid, then the scammer and PayPal should be at fault, not me. I even expressed my discomfort/concern about shipping the items back to the seller (out of pocket) multiple times. The scammers provided me 3 different addresses, and I was advised by the PayPal executive, Catherine, to ship everything back together to one address. Clearly that didn't work in my favor. I HATE this company, and I wish for their swift downfall.25 Jun 2023:I got a response from the PayPal executive, Anne, after I sent an email about my cases getting closed in the seller's favor even though THEY provided an invalid address. Of course I get this useless response:""I understand that you are disappointed about the outcome of the case. Kindly contact your financial institution to check for options on getting a refund.I have thoroughly researched the facts of this matter and can confirm our decision remains unchanged. We regret any frustration or inconvenience you have experienced with our services and, while we understand this may not be the answer you were hoping for, we believe our actions to be consistent with PayPal's User Agreement.""They don't know their own ""PayPal's User Agreement"" because I get inconsistent responses from customer service and the so called ""executives."" So, nothing about the ""PayPal's User Agreement"" is consistent.

Don't do it.,"I've had my PayPal account for 22 years. It's a personal account. A friend just transferred a large-ish sum of money to me. I get an email from PayPal saying they've held 85% of the funds for this ""purchase"" until I ship the ""item"" to the ""customer"", and they've kept $347.00 US as a ""service fee"". When I called PayPal, their customer service supervisor, Mark, was incredibly rude to me. He basically told me I'm out the $347, they can't tell me when my account was changed to business account, and he was incredibly rude about it. So this account I've had for 22 years is suddenly a business account, but they can't tell me how. They can't FIX the problem. They can't give me the $347 back. On top of that, they're holding 85% of the funds for TWENTY-ONE DAYS, and the other 15% of the funds, they said they'd release. So I went online to transfer the funds to the VERIFIED BANK ON THE ACCOUNT which has been verified for OVER A DECADE, and I was required to submit a photo of my ID, and a current photo of myself, before they'd release. So I did that, and they told me they can't release the funds because they can't verify it's me. WHAT??? Look, I don't know how many random strangers want to put money INTO my bank account, but should this really be an issue? It's a PayPal account TIED TO a specific bank account, and so what does it matter WHO is putting the funds into the account, as long as the funds are going into the bank account tied to the PayPal account. Seriously, people nowadays seem to have problems with logic. And all of this frustration has only cost me the small (lol) sum of $347.",1,2023-06-04T20:50:15.000Z,tess

Paypal supporting Fraudsters,"I recently had a highly disappointing experience with PayPal's customer service regarding a dispute I made, and I feel compelled to share my frustration. On the 15th of May, I fell victim to a deceptive scheme by the company 123helpme.com. Despite signing up for a £7 seven-day trial, they sneakily charged me a staggering £119.40 for an entire year. Outraged by this fraudulent activity, I immediately canceled my subscription and sought a refund from the company.Upon reaching out to PayPal, I diligently followed all the necessary procedures and provided substantial evidence to support my claim. However, to my utter dismay, the back office staff closed my case, siding with the fraudsters, without conducting a proper investigation. It became apparent that their laziness and lack of commitment led to a negligent resolution in favor of the fraudulent company.This unprofessional conduct not only reflects poorly on PayPal as a trusted platform but also leaves customers vulnerable to corporate fraud schemes. The fact that 123helpme.com operates under the guise of a legitimate company, ""Barnes and Noble,"" only adds insult to injury. PayPal's failure to take appropriate action against these wrongdoers not only enables their fraudulent practices but also demonstrates a lack of accountability on their part.I am deeply disappointed by the lack of diligence, care, and attention to detail exhibited by PayPal's staff members in handling my dispute. As a customer who relies on PayPal for secure transactions, I expected better service and support. It is disheartening to see a company of PayPal's stature failing to address the concerns of its customers in an efficient and satisfactory manner.I strongly urge PayPal to reevaluate its dispute resolution procedures and ensure that cases are thoroughly investigated, giving due consideration to the evidence provided by affected customers. I hope my review serves as a wake-up call for PayPal to prioritize the well-being and trust of its customers, taking proactive steps to prevent such instances of mishandled disputes in the future.",1,2023-06-03T17:50:23.000Z,Ibrahim

After I submitted that, they wanted detailed explanations of each invoice, all of which I provided.I got an email an hour after stating that they were going to be locking my account permanently, and the money in the account was going to be held for an extended period of time, no doubt so they could try to make a few bucks by loaning it out.

Told to wait for a reply from seller to them. They got a reply saying item was delivered by FedEx and a number. Looking at the FedEx paperwork no delivery address totally wrong post code and said four items not one. Looked in it company name, not on companies House and available to buy.

Secondly you’ve already made a payment to myself and thirdly I am not sending a copy of my driver’s license, bank card and credit card details to lift the restrictions and due to this they will not let me close my account with them due to this (I seriously think that is wrong and possibly verging on some illegal activities on there behalf).

PayPal staff are now scamming.,"A ""Pinkbike scammer"" stated they were selling me a mountain bike frame. I paid for it through PayPal as a professional services: specifically, ""Goods and Services.""The next day, PayPal created an ""Item Not Received"" case on my behalf without my consent. There were two blank notes written in a dispute that I never created. I then created a hacked account dispute and signified this transaction. For one thing, the original Pinkbike scammer email that I paid through PayPal had a new transaction email listed on PayPal.Within a few hours of notifying PayPal of my hacked account claim, my claim was denied and a payment of $750 was sent to a totally random person/account that I never sent any funds too originally.At this time, it strongly appears that someone at PayPal is scamming PayPal. To confirm, Paypal denied my case and are looking to pay $750 to a secondary scammer. It's incredibly strange and totally irresponsible to see how this is building momentum.I can assure you, I verified my PayPal account via the app and also the desktop website regarding this strange PayPal behavior.",1,2023-05-31T05:33:49.000Z,AZ Camera

I have written to complaints also, but that department is equally useless, and there is no way to escalate a complaint past the complaints and disputes departments - I have had the most stressful ongoing experience with PayPal advisors over the phone  - over 10+ calls, and through writing - proof of postage; proof of delivery provided etc.. yet PayPal are still not refunding my money - steer well clear of this company!",1,2023-05-30T22:51:43.000Z,TM 2004

Was eagerly waiting for a payment from a client who felt it best to pay via Paypal as it is one of my many payment options. The money came in and suddenly was on hold for a week. The reason given was that I had not transacted in a while and they needed a week to verify. So I gave them the week... after the week, the money was still not there... I contacted support and they told me usually they only have human intervention after 21 days!! Pressing on the conversation 2 weeks in, as I need the money from my client, I talk to a guy in support who finally bothers to do some checks and then sets it up for another week (today as of writing this review) to enter my account. Right now, still nothing, and I am on hold with support. They sent me a ""please review our service"" e-mail as if they have even resolved anything.

"PayPal REFUSES TO REFUND MONEY FOR ITEM CANCELLED, NEVER SHIPPED, AND NEVER DELIVERED","PayPal refuses to refund money taken from by bank account via ACH for a purchase that was cancelled same day of purchase with both PayPal and the seller Mr. Porter . PayPal is trying to contort the narrative that I attempted to use a PayPal credit that was denied . As a result they took money via bank ACH . Here is the problem with that lie and misinformation. The purchase was made May 14 online at the Mr. Porter website. I choose the payment via payment in 4 via my American Express . It’s the method I always use . When I realized the full amount, I immediately called PayPal . They were closed . Their online chat bot referred my to the portal . I checked cancel agreement. A few hours later when they opened , I called an cancelled on the telephone. Then I called the seller Mr. Porter . I cancelled twice . First with a rep, and then a manager . The manager confirmed the cancellation. I then called PayPal to confirm. PayPal told me I was good . But the money was from my debit card . That was rarely use my debit card . It’s always American Express due to their buyers protection . I underscored with PayPal the order was CANCELED. Much to my chagrin, the next day the took money via ACH from my bank. I filed multiple disputes with PayPal. I even had the seller CONFIRM the order was cancelled, never shipped , and never delivered. Yet papal continues to play games refunding $1317 to my account. I even have an email from the seller confirming the refund and cancellation. Moreover , I have an email from a PayPal rep named John . He confirmed the seller had until May 25. At that point PayPal would refund . It’s May 28, and PayPal has now asked until June 4. Unacceptable. Their new supervisor Avinish has twisted the narrative to say I wanted to use a PayPal seller credit ( of which there is ZERO credit available) to make a $1317 purchase ? That’s preposterous and a lie . I wanted the purchase from my American Express with pay in 4 option . They CONVENIENTLY obviated that payment option because they knew Amex had buyers protection where debit cards rarely have this . As of May 28, I have sent Paypay the sellers email confirming the refund and cancellation. PayPal also has the RECORDING of their own rep John saying the dispute would be closed by May 25 and my money refunded .PayPal has engaged in predatory and bad business practices. I am demanding my $1317 refunded ASAP. The level of deception & predatory business practices by PayPal is unfathomable. Avinish from their executive office is either incompetent or cognitively impacted with an inability to understand this is not about a “ denied PayPal credit, “ it’s about PayPal taking money from my account on an order CANCELLED SAME DAY TWICE W PAYPAL & seller Mr. Porter, than having the seller send an email detailing they HAVE REFUNDED the money for an item NEVER SHIPPED & NEVER  DELIVERED.

MOST UNPROFESSIONAL AND FRAUD SERVICE FOR INTERNATIONAL USERS,"Firstly it is very difficult to set up and payment from my bank goes with no problem but if you're using PayPal Internationally (using from India in my case) and getting paid by clients domestically & internationally, it automatically sends my money to my bank account and somehow the money doesn't get into my bank account. It only returns automatically to Paypal and Paypal automatically keeps sending it back to the bank in that loop continuously every day. I can't even transfer it anywhere else or make a purchase with that money. Now I've also been complaining to customer support for a YEAR now, but every time I have to explain this to a chatbot or a different staff and it is a headache. After countless emails back and forth and months, they keep saying ""Please wait for a few days, it will reflect in your account"" every time by a different person, and the transfer never happens. Talking to my bank they never receive any money sent from Paypal. Now for my peace of mind, I deactivated and closed my PayPal account with all that money in the loop and I am happier to let go of those hard-earned dollars that keep going back and forth from PayPal to my bank account and back to PayPal in a loop then use this stupid unsupportive service where I have just have headache and wasted a lot of time and money. I recommend that we never use such unprofessional Payment gateways anymore and stand up and ban such fraud companies!

If I ran a business the way paypal does I'd be bankrupt with no customers in no time at all - how they exist in 2023 is beyond me, given that there are MUCH better payment platforms out there. PayPal's downfall is its inability to function as a payment platform, it exists to take money paid to you, take huge fees and give AWFUL conversion rates, then, for it to make you BEG for your money by placing ridiculous limitations on your account and then providing NO HUMAN HELP - just complete automation which I've heard drives some to the bring of insanity - holding money in excess of 180 days, bringing some small businesses to its knees. We've had ENDLESS account limitations - I am happy to share ALL EVIDENCE of what we've gone through and if the review is removed we'll take legal action against TrustPilot for removing a genuine, non offensive review. I am the owner of SEO AUDITS IO - we sell digital products, we've had CONSTANT problems with PayPal placing limitations on our account, wanting us to send months of bank statements, submit proof on lots of transactions even though people buy a digital product and receive a download from the website, somehow we're supposed to provide this proof over and over again - yet we use stripe and never have any of these issues? funny that. Stay WELL AWAY from Paypal if you value your sanity - I've been shoehorned into using Paypal for many years but now there are lots of other platforms out there it's time for unhappy people to vote with their feet.

I would give zero stars if I could,"I would give zero stars if I could. I am a very small business and have had 2 customers buy products from my website overseas. One refused/declined the delivery as they had to pay a tax which is stated on my website we are not responsible for any taxes to receive goods and another didn’t pick up their package on time from the post office and so the packages were returned back to me as unclaimed. The two customers both made a complaint and escalated the matter and said they never received their packages. I had all receipts, emails, screenshots, photos and proof that packages were sent and were unclaimed by the customers. But PayPal still decided to side with the customers even though they were at fault. I am now out of pocket almost $200. I will no longer be using PayPal as one of my services for my business and will be telling every other person I know that PayPal is a scam and does not care about the small businesses that work hard to earn their money!",1,2023-05-25T12:33:32.000Z,Liz
"Dreadful company, will never use them again","Absolutely dreadful company and customer service, will NEVER use them again. Bought a ticket in July 2022 for an event that was meant to be in Nov 2022, but it got postponed to April 2023 and then postponed again with no date set yet. It was paid for in 3 instalments through PayPal's ""Pay in 3"" credit system so I asked PayPal to refund me. The lady I spoke to at PayPal said I have up to a year to claim with credit payments so this should be fine, so I submitted my request and received an automated response rejecting my request as it was over 180 days since the payment. I contacted them to explain that it wasn't my fault it went outside the 180 eays as the postponements were beyond my control and they just sent another automated response rejecting it again. I tried ringing their disputes team but after 2 hours of waiting I had to give up and I'm sure it wouldn't have gotten me anywhere anyway from what I've read about them",1,2023-05-25T11:15:05.000Z,Justin

Customer even called and confirmed receiving the goods in good standing. While PayPal saying they still gonna hold the money for up to 21days. We'll after going back and forth with them for misleading their customers they finally released the funds. They changed me 16.95 to receive 800.00 and then charged another 16.75 to transfer my money to my account instantly. On top of that the money hit my account until the next day.

WHAT???? So some random person, who I've never met, got 2K of my money and there was nothing I could do about it!

Incompetent and infuriating,"Most of the time, Paypal works fine, and it's great. But when it goes wrong, get ready for a LOT of stress.I was paid for the sale of an item through Paypal, who emailed me to say that they were holding the payment until I could provide them with some ID details to verify my account. I did so immediately, and received a reply email to say ""thanks, we have lifted the limitations on your account""... but the payment never came. When I tried to ask them about this, they said that they'd need the transaction ID number, to trace the payment. But I wasn't given one, as the payment never happened. So, they asked me to contact the payer, to ask them for the transaction ID (why should I have to do this? they made the error). I tried anyway, but of course I could not get one. This then went on for thirteen days. I would message Paypal through their only means of contact, their awful message centre that times you out randomly, doesn't save anything you've typed, and gives your message to a new assistant every time, so of course you have to explain everything from the start again and again and again. Thirteen days of me having to explain the same thing to multiple assistants, who constantly assured me that they ""understand my frustration"" and ""will do all that we can to help"", and then just ask me for the transaction ID again. Very infuriating. At more than one point, they confused the missing payment with others that had happened smoothly, and asked me what the problem was. They also tried to suggest that the email from them, saying that they were holding the payment until I provided ID, was some sort of false email from a scammer. When I eventually managed to get through on the phone, after a 95 minute phone call, the assistant obviously realised the mistake that Paypal had made at the start, and sent me the initial email again (the one from 13 days previous), then got me to remove my email address from my account, then put it back in. This worked! Which proves that the error was totally on Paypal's side, nowhere else... so then I get a final message from Paypal, saying that they are ""confident"" that they did nothing wrong, and that the error was down to me inputting something wrong. They gave me no way to answer this, and ended the conversation. They deliberately showed no accountability for their obvious mistake, and allowed me no way to answer this. I continue to use them, but only because I have to. If there were other methods that my business could use, I'd drop Paypal in a heartbeat.",1,2023-05-24T15:18:06.000Z,Dan

"If you're a seller, avoid at all costs.","If you're a seller, use Stripe and avoid PayPal at all costs.They have the highest fees and the slowest withdrawals.

I have removed this as a payment option on my website and regret ever adding. Prior to my experiences with it this year, I haven't really used PayPal since the early eBay days and I have no idea what they spent the last 20 years doing, as the user experience is unbelievably bad. Where most companies try to make processes as smooth as possible and remove any friction points, I'm almost certain PayPal do the opposite; if there's a process that should take 3 clicks and a few seconds to perform, they will find a way to drag it out for a whole month and require numerous emails to customer support.",1,2023-05-23T18:16:04.000Z,NN

Disappointing,"I recently had a highly disappointing encounter with PayPal, which left me feeling frustrated and powerless. As a responsible consumer, I believe it is important to share my experience to warn others about the potential pitfalls they may encounter while using this service.The trouble began when my PayPal account was abruptly blocked without any prior warning or explanation. This sudden action left me bewildered and concerned about the security of my funds and transactions. Despite trying to understand the reason behind the account suspension, I was left in the dark with no access to my funds or any explanation from PayPal's end.Naturally, my first instinct was to reach out to PayPal's customer service to resolve the issue and regain access to my account. Unfortunately, my attempts to communicate with them proved to be extremely frustrating. Not only did I face long wait times, but when I finally managed to speak with a representative, they seemed disinterested and unwilling to assist me.To my utter disbelief, the customer service agent I spoke with abruptly hung up on me while I was in the middle of explaining my situation. This act of outright dismissal left me feeling undervalued as a customer and betrayed by a company I had trusted with my financial transactions.The lack of transparency and the dismissive behavior of PayPal's customer service were not only unprofessional but also deeply concerning. A company of PayPal's stature should be held to a higher standard when it comes to customer support and the handling of account-related issues. Unfortunately, my experience with them fell far short of this expectation.I understand that issues can arise with any service, but it is how a company deals with those issues that truly matters. In this regard, PayPal's response was unacceptable. The lack of communication and the dismissive behavior from their customer service team left me with a lingering sense of frustration and dissatisfaction.As a result of this distressing encounter, I strongly caution potential users to be wary of relying solely on PayPal for their financial transactions. While it may be a widely used and convenient platform, my experience highlights the potential risks and frustrations that can arise if something goes wrong.I sincerely hope that PayPal takes these criticisms seriously and works towards improving their customer service, transparency, and account management processes. Until then, I cannot recommend PayPal as a reliable and customer-friendly option for online payments and transactions.",1,2023-05-22T20:30:06.000Z,Chantelle Atkins

Limits account and perma limits after reporting suspicious purchase,"April 26th, 2022. Went to see a movie with my family. Came home to find out both my roblox account and my paypal was actually hacked. I made the report to roblox about the situation (long story short the situation there was resolved quickly and swiftly with the hackers account being terminated). As for paypal? All they did was limit my account. For what reason? No explanation. 10 purchases made in Rubles (Russia's currency) all for some mushroom app. I don't know what it was but it was obviously a scam which I had since canceled. After explaining to paypal customer service very clearly they said, ""We apologize we did not find anything suspicious on your account"" Keep in mind that the Ukraine war was (and still is to this day) ongoing. Rubles are completely worthless in Russia. So I just lost all the money I had left on my cards because paypal is too incompetent to send an alert saying, ""A purchase was made for (whatever item)"". After sending multiple replies calling out the fraudulent purchases they limited my account and stopped giving me service. Don't trust paypal or their ""customer service"" it's just run by a bot that can't even answer your question without sending the ""we can no longer provide service to your account""",1,2023-05-18T07:49:47.000Z,Shadow
I’ve been using PayPal for YEARS,"I’ve been using PayPal for YEARS, I tried to checkout with them yesterday through an e-commerce store (Shopiosx) and they limited my account and asked ME to send a ID In. I literally just went through this process a month ago when I sold on eBay and when my funds became available after the buyer checked it as delivered I wasn’t able to withdraw and had to verify my account. Now I’m stuck with an unusable PayPal account, phone support hasn’t been able to assist..",1,2023-05-17T22:46:43.000Z,M Rhett

Scammers! I really give negative stars!!,"There really needs to be a zero star option, or better yet, a negative star option. Pretty sure that the only reason PayPal has any stars at all, because there's no zero or negative star option. PayPal has THE WORST customer service EVER! They don't care about your money, they just want it all! They put 5-7 day holds on funds, and sometimes more. Days after you bank says it's long gone from them, PayPal claims it hasn't reached them yet. Bull pucky! They claim it is slower electronically than through snail mail. Bull pucky! You tell them whom you paid is a known scammer, and they don't care. In my book, that makes them complicit with scammers, which makes them scammers themselves 🤷. Prove me wrong on this. They try to turn all of the culpability back on your bank, when it's even out of the banks hands. What is Paypal for, if they won't protect the honest? They are literally pointless!! Don't give them your money. They are scammers, and will steal from you! I'm done with you, PayPal! You've gotten THE LAST of my money!",1,2023-05-17T21:44:58.000Z,Vicky

I lost out on a 1000-pound deal because…,"I lost out on a 1000-pound deal because PayPal continuously blocked the transaction.The error message provided did not indicate a reason for this and was a generic ""Just try again later"" message.The support staff on their website do not know what the message means, and I was given at least 6 different reasons, in full confidence each time, all of which were apparently incorrect.The telephone agents do not understand what this message means, and gave me a different reason as well.The team on Twitter - a completely unrelated social media platform, were the only ones who could actually answer my question, and the answer was:""It happens when a fraud concern is raised but no one can tell why this concern was raised, and you will never be notified of this.""So a payment provider is refusing to do their one job (provide payments), and their system is set up in such a way that none of their support staff are able to find out what has happened or is even aware that such anti-fraud measures exist.Then, a complaint is raised on my behalf, and the response to it is, in essence, ""We are the best company on earth. We do SO well. Look how great we are. P.S. This was caused by an anti-fraud measure that none of our staff are trained on because... well we don't know, but we're a great company! P.P.S. We won't be fixing these issues. It will likely happen to you again.""PayPal - you are one of the most hated companies on the face of the earth for a very simple reason; Your customer support is HORRENDOUS. Read my lips: HORR. EN. DOUS.P.S.I sure would have loved it if ANY of these security measures kicked in when my account was hacked, my 2FA was bypassed, my card was used to make several Chinese purchases, and my PayPal Me username was set to something incredibly racist (which cannot be undone, mind you!

Beware of PayPal,"Beware of PayPal. I do not recommend anyone ever opening up an account with them. Unfortunately, I learned my lesson too late. I have been a loyal customer with this company for years, and outside of maybe one representative that was helpful no one else has been helpful. This is the most unprofessional, unethical and completely Clueless company that I've ever dealt with. I was on hold waiting for a live representative for so long, and when I finally connected to one her level of stupidity was shocking. Just to think they have complete morons answering your call to only send you to another department that sends you back to that dreadful automated system that sends you through all these unnecessary channels just to speak to a rep. I have always paid my bills on time. This month I paid my bill before the due date thinking they would give me credit for this month and since it posted for April instead of May they charged me a late fee of $30. I was trying to get the fee waived and it's like pulling teeth they gave me the run around the first rep said she didn't see it because it was the dispute department and said she would send me to the right department then back to the automated line she sent me. Then I called back again hoping for a better rep that didn't happen. I explained to her the reason for my call and what the first rep didn't resolve for me, and she assured me that she would send me to the correct department after putting notes in the system and did the same thing. I was no longer going to waste any more of my valuable time talking to people that obviously don't care about their customers they should all be ashamed of themselves. Do not waste your time or money on this worthless credit card company you can do much better some where else. I'm so happy I have good credit and have other ways of using other credit cards wisely so I don't ever have to use them again.",1,2023-05-17T08:27:50.000Z,Shonda Coleman

Also, if you miss one payment and do not pay in full they keep adding late fees...illegally. they can only add one late fees per each late payment, or as stated above.

#1 you try to do the right thing and…,#1 you try to do the right thing and make ur payment calling the collections # they stalk with even after u have asked for an extension to a certain date.  But they charge me a single time after my extension or turn off of auto payments as they call it.  Well with me knowing when I challenged the payment with my bank like PayPal told me to do. They In turn shut off all my payments to PayPal just not the one.  But before I knew this I called collections after trying twice me giving him my whole credit card # he hung up on me.  U guess he thought I was lying or he thought he wasn’t getting any where with me.  Then I called shdin after clearing the matter up with my bank on the request of my bank I called again to explain what happened it would take up to 2 days for the shut off to be turned back on by my bank to auth paypal payments.  Well after we tried it again once like the bank recommended it didn’t go thru I wasn’t surprised I asked her to document everything I told her however she was pressed on getting an answer whether I would be paying on the 18th by phone or cell p hi one.  I answered her when I asked to ask a question I got hung up on again. After she was attiment the other caller didn’t hang up on me he noted the live disconnected she just happened to hang up too when she knew she wasn’t getting a payment right then.   This is disgusting behavior.    I’m sssuming they work on commission unless I’m making them money they are done with u.  I’m going to call the regular # next time customer service see if they will take my payment not collections.,1,2023-05-16T21:51:53.000Z,Tracy

Beware of PayPal and some lying Etsy sellers,"Should be zero stars. Beware, this company will side with the sellers who lie about their location address, and they will not refund you. Had an experience, where I brought an item from Etsy the sellers name is Silver Arts please beware of them, they lied on their profile saying that they are based in the United states but they are clearly based in India; which I only got to find out through the tracking information when the item was sent but sadly, by then was too late to reverse the process. I opened a case with PayPal and provided ALL the evidence ie screenshots of the seller website and the package and the item details all proving my point that the seller lied and sent a damaged item too. However, they didn't even care to see it not to mention acted like I was making it up and just automatically closed the case and sided with the lying seller. Basically, they really don't care about sellers lying about their locations. They expect me to return an item at my own cost ie to India, when the seller lied about what country the item is from. As if I will pay ridiculous postage costs from my own pocket for a sellers own lie! Avoid like the plague. Also the customer service they give is atrocious, not professional very condescending and patronizing.

Paypal demanded balance of 250k and retained money with no warning or reason.,"I'm a small business owner running subscription products and events. In 2022 paypal wrote to me out of the blue and demanded that I retain a minimum balance of 250k with them - my bank doesn't require this, stripe doesn't require this but apparently PayPal had decided that a small business should. Of course the benefit to them is that having these funds from lots of businesses no doubt yields great cash pooling returns - but it was simply impossible for us to do this (plus I saw no legitimate reason for the request) and so we declined. This led to us ditching ticketing system which required the use of paypal for overseas events. Paypal then decided to retain £30k of our sales - not a massive amount, I know - but since it isn't theirs and they had no business doing this I complained. Customer service was appalling - routinely sent stock answers and no one would get on the phone to explain what was happening or to allow me to contribute to their risk assessment process. They told me they'd keep the funds for 180 days, but now we are past that and they refuse to repay the money. Customer service keep sending the same stock answers that were clearly more geared to retail businesses and not remotely relevant to event businesses with cyclical events. The whole experience has been dreadful. No one will take accountability, no one will get on the phone or provide anything other than scripted answers and no one will consider the evidence from my own business and rely on computer-generate assumptions which are wholly incorrect. I am utterly baffled by the market share they have. A poor product with no interest in customer service. Thankfully we have found an alternative solution based in stripe and are getting good, responsive support and no demands for ridiculous balances of cash. Still working on the return of funds from them though... next step is legal action.",1,2023-05-16T11:24:36.000Z,CA

AVOID AVOID AVOID FOR ANY HIGHER VALUE PURCHASES,"Bought a set of brand new factory made £600+ chairs from a company online and the chairs arrived firstly damaged, half finished (yes genuinely) missing sticking and piping, the wrong material (leather and it was plastic) and completely different sizes to the quoted. The company unbeknown to me (no evidence on the website and it is not easy to find an address) is in China. Paypal have said that I can get a full refund if I post the four stools back to China at my cost.Postage is going to cost me over £400 via courier and it's the cheapest we can find. Paypal also forced me to get a third party appraisal of the chairs as they didn't believe our photos or information. We spend days finding a company to perform this appraisal and had to pay £225 to get it done which I expected to be refunded as they requested we get one. They have refused to refund us the appraisal and have said we can send the stools back at our cost.£225 + £400 postage = £625 The chairs cost £618 so now we have the dilemma of being £225 already out of pocket and sending them back or being forced to keep them so we dont loose anymore money. I have made over 5 complaints to PayPal and requested higher level management contact us to sort the issue out all of which has been completely brushed under the carpet.

This has made my last 3 payments for a bull I have get paid as an “e-cheque”. This takes up to 10 days to process.THIS HAS COST ME.I even went into the minus on my PayPal account by about £36. I tried to pay it back and guess what?! It was sent as a ECheque. In the meantime PayPal called me about me owing them.They could see the issue but couldn’t fix it.But today:I had £50 balance in my account.And I added £10.Imagine my surprise when later in the afternoon I had £4.81There is NO RECORD of it leaving my account at all.I have spoke to customer services - different people who just sound like A.IHonestly explaining it to me over and over but missing the point that money has left my account TODAY and their is no record of it at all.I told them I’m going to close my account down because essentially they can just take money from my account and not tell me they have or where it has gone.And they basically said “ok fine”",1,2023-05-11T19:12:25.000Z,Dennis

They have a huge amount of the market share and allowing them to create a lifetime ban with no notice ahead of time and no explanation nor opportunity to resolve points to the need for regulatory oversight into a business such as this.

Don't expect Palpal to protect you against fraud,"I was recently the victim of a fraudulent Web site where I paid for (non-existent) merchandise with Paypal. Once I realized I had been duped, I filed a claim immediately with Paypal via their online forms. It was totally impossible to contact any live person during this dispute. The fraudulent Web site produced a tracking number from my local post office showing the item was delivered, but the tracking number referred to some other residence in my zip code, not my house. I obtained a letter from the post office verifying that the tracking number was not my address. Paypal refused to consider this evidence and dismissed my case, with no way to reopen the case on their site. Paypal clearly has no interest in protecting its customers from nefarious merchants.

PayPal stated that you needed more info.  I asked what was needed besides the photos that I had attached, which meet your requirements.

No protection with PayPal,"No protection with PayPal - stay away Afterwards using this method of payment I’ve been shocked as to how poor this service now is. We bought an oil delivery for £1055 from Boiker Juice (don’t ever use them also). Basically, the oil wasn’t added to the tank when they delivered as they didn’t find the tank so they left my property. I rang BJ and was pretty annoyed, cancelled the order and ordered from a local delivery agent. BJ then re delivered when we had already had new oil delivered and could only fit a small amount in the tank - which of course we didn’t want. We advised BJ to refund, they refused. Not only had they taken my money without authorisation and delivered something we didn’t want, they refused to even give us the rest of our money back for a huge under delivery. So, we presumed PayPal would help. It’s been 3 months and PayPal have again found in favour of the oil company. They seem to pay no attention to the facts - even if I was to pay for the oil I didn’t want the company should refund me about 780£ as they couldn’t deliver the whole order! PayPal repeatedly loose evidence provided by myself and merely say ‘no evidence submitted so case closed’, say the description of the case doesn’t match the claim (there are no suitable titles to submit under!) - today they’ve dismissed my claim as the title was ‘significantly different from description’ - but totally dismissed the fact that a) the order was cancelled so BJ shouldn’t have delivered or use my money and b) they only delivered a fraction of the oil agreed and therefore owe me £100’snkf pounds. Assistants promise you they will help - and the. Never make contact again. You can’t speak to anyone in disputes so no one understands your case. PayPal are bullies who are not members of the finance committee which govern uk finance since we left Europe - hence they are getting away with financial murder, I will delete my account and have to go to small claims court now.

They promised to release the balance within 3 to 5 business days of the confirmation. I've been waiting two weeks for my funds to be released. Today, customer service wrote that it can take up to 21 days for the funds to be released. Now they will contact my client for additional confirmation of completion before releasing the balance. Because it is a new account they will determine the amount of the hold each time a payment is made which means I will go through the same headache/waiting period every time a customer makes payment to me.

I once loved Paypal. I hope they can win me back.,"I once loved Paypal. I hope to again. Here's how they've insulted me enough to receive my indignance and this review:Suddenly the default payment by my credit card on my paypal account was no longer an option. And the default was now a credit option with a zero interest rate. I tried paypal's ""pay in four payments"" zero-interest option a few times in the past with zero problems, so I simply completed my transaction with their credit option default.I repeat: my original default credit card payment option was not even extant. I wasn't there to be found.So I used this credit default a couple times. Not a large total. (Hundreds, not thousands.)When I called to make a payment  --hopefully by my normal default credit card--  I was told by someone they had to transfer me. Then that happened from the second person, too. Then I was at Synchrony bank. I don't like Synchrony bank, I learned from the folderol through Amazon ""credit"" that I never asked for, too. I cancelled Synchrony after the Amazon credit fiasco.Well, now, here they are from paypal  --again without my having ever asked them to become my creditor. (I did make the mistake of presuming the credit option that was the default by paypal in place of my normal, usual default credit card pay-in-full option was paypal. I had no idea I was suddenly in bed with Synchrony again.)So I called paypal again. And again. Asking for a supervisor. I was told a supervisor would return the call. That day. ""In an hour of two."" Nope. No return call.And now there is an interest charge  --of a usury fee rate, no less--  on my few hundred dollars.This is crooked.This is what we used to call ""rip-off.""And can one speak with anyone live?Not at paypal, no. One can get transferred to Synchrony after much folderol. But not at paypal, no.I hope paypal makes this right.",1,2023-05-04T20:50:16.000Z,F. Harstad
Wouldn’t bother,"I’ve tried multiple times to verify payment methods & use a payment method but I am continuously hit with error messages & vague explanations as to why I can’t. I originally tried to use the pay in 3 service which refused to use one of my cards due to a verification issue even though I had verified the card multiple times in app & by phone. After giving up on this I tried to use a different, already verified card to complete the purchase which errored half way through the process to tell me ‘pay in 3 is not available for this purchase now’.

Paypal Is A Shadow Of Its Former Self,"Paypal used to be the online payment processing company, it is now a shadow of its former self, when I used to sell on ebay I was using it to transfer thousands of pounds every month, now most sites have migrated to their own payments systems it is no longer needed, I had still been using my account until today for a few hundred pounds per month but after the fiasco of trying to send an invoice for £5.95 its not worth the hassle, for some reason it wouldn't allow me to send the invoice, gave me no explanation as to why, contacted customer services and after 15 min couldn't give me a reason why, after over 20 years I am closing my account",1,2023-05-04T13:51:10.000Z,neil

Shiesty Practices,"I would give Paypal 0 stars if possible I rarely follow through with reviews but this truly shows the depth of, Paypal's sheisty business practices. Initially, I opened a Paypal account, as I was told Paypal provides extra protection for the consumer. That has not been my experience and  unfortunately, I also had my son open a Paypal account as a means for me to transfer money to him. Tuesday, he attempted to register for school and found his funds frozen. According to the Paypal rep he spoke with, he has to be 18 to have a Paypal account. If so, (I asked) how did Paypal manage to allow the account to be set up? Second, why did Paypal allow the transfer of funds to the account? Last but not least, why is it they will not release my funds to me?  Rhetorical question...The representative I spoke with this morning, told me funds are not reversible once sent. Followed by, she spoke to her supervisor who said, my son needs to call Paypal to confirm what I am saying and Paypal will ATTEMPT to find a way to reverse the funds.The same minor son with whom Paypal spoke to yesterday, with whom they cannot do business, the same minor son whose contract is unenforceable??? Although, Paypal acknowledges seeing the transfer from my account to his, the money can neither be utilized by my son, nor reversed back to me because he is 17. They need to speak to him AGAIN to ATTEMPT figuring out a way to resolve the problem...I wouldn't trust this company with arcade tokens, let alone my money !!!",1,2023-05-03T17:06:06.000Z,Patient

THEY ENABLE FRAUDULENT DISPUTES/CHARGEBACKS ON THEIR PLATFORM,"I am married to a toxic woman that lives in USA while I live in the Caribbean. We share a child together and I depend on her to bring my child to me on a yearly basis, as I cannot travel to the states because I do not have a Visa. I use PayPal to send money to her to maintain our child on a monthly basis and for any other miscellaneous expenses I need to cover on behalf of my daughter. My ""wife"" and I had planned for her to visit me with my daughter and we agreed to split expenses right down the middle, with PayPal being the platform used. My wife was supposed to book the flight and I agreed to reimburse half of the money (Sent via PayPal) and I would book a hotel stay in my home country and she would reimburse half of the money (also sent via PayPal). Now we booked both the Hotel and the Flight months in advance we so get the best rates, and it so happened that my ""wife"" and myself were at odds before the trip was to take place, and she decided to be petty and filed a false dispute against me on their platform stating that she paid for goods and services she didn't receive. I responded to her dispute by escalating the case to a claim and provided all necessary evidence to PayPal support to show that the dispute was false. I paid $1040 from my own pocket to book the hotel and she sent me back $520 on PayPal. She disputed the charges because she wanted to cancel the whole trip and keep my kid away from me in USA, knowing I am not able to travel there. I uploaded the booking details of the Hotel stay showing CLEARLY 2 adults one child, oh and by the way the hotel stay is non-refundable. I also uploaded our marriage certificate, showing that me and the supposed ""buyer that didn't receive their goods"" are married. There is also a paper trail of consistently sending money to the ""buyer"" for our child's needs, all of which I noted down in my escalation to PayPal support, along with detailed screenshots of conversations with me and her where she admits that she is filing a fraudulent dispute against me because she is upset about an argument we had. I also sent in proof of our conversations where she agreed to reimburse me half the money back. And this company took all this evidence, and proceeded to refund my wife all the money, leaving me with a negative balance on my PayPal account charged for a supposed strike against my account, and also leaving me out $1040 for a booking for me, a woman, and a child, that will not be showing up, that is not refundable. I called in their support team (which seems to be based in the Philippines) and went at great lengths to explain this case to them over and over and 3 different occasions. Not withstanding that the contact center is based in the Philippines, on several occasions they tried to refuse me any assistance because I am not located in the US myself, and I had to get crazy and refuse to leave the line for them to even look into my case. I tried a total of three times to re-open this case and get them to do the right thing and all I received were promises that they understand and see that I deserve for the dispute to be reversed, and a rude supervisor who told me point blank she doesn't care about me and my wife (even though they enabled a false dispute on their platform, which is FRAUD). You're better off putting money in a sock and sending it in a suitcase overseas, or using Western Union. This  is a complete incompetent sham of a Company that discriminates against people that do not live in the USA, even though we ALL pay to use the platform.

Useless company if you ever go international.,"If you're living in the country you registed PayPal with, it's probably a 3 or 4 star business. I had no issues with them while I was living in Australia, my country of residence.However, a few months ago I moved internationally for the year, and trying to deal with PayPal is nightmarish. You essentially can't access your account without access to your phone number, and they won't allow you to attach an international phone number to the account (unlike, say, National Australia Bank which did allow me to do this, like a decent business would). PayPal themselves literally told me to create a new account for use in Cambodia, despite numerous sources from them saying you can only have one personal account (I did make the new account, due to them putting that direction down in writing).If that's not all bad enough, I now can't access that Cambodian account because they demanded to send a one time code to my phone, yet never actually sent it (and the number was working as my partner sent me a text while this was happening). That failed enough times, and I can't currently reset my password because apparently Google auto-suspended my Cambodian email account for some reason (I imagine safety, as it may look like a phishing email given that it's my name + country after it).But all in all, all this frustration is being caused by PayPal, and frankly their ridiculous approach to international usage. Be warned: if you plan on travelling overseas, don't use PayPal. At all. It'll cause nothing but pain. If you never plan on travelling it's probably fine to keep using it.",1,2023-05-02T05:40:48.000Z,Jaxson Bateman

Actively supporting fraudsters,"Too many problems to go into. One issue after another over some years. The most recent issue was a company accidentally/fraudulently withdrew €180 from my PayPal account which ended up as a transaction applied to my credit card. What was whack about this was this was a charity I had made a donation to years ago using a credit card payment. That card had long since expired. However, when this charity requested a payment years later on the same credit card (now expired), PayPal honoured the request but on a new different card, the one I now have attached to my account! They effectively honoured a fraudulent transaction on one card by applying it to another they had on file. Words fail me to describe how screwed up that is. The last of many serious issues I have had with this untrustworthy company.",1,2023-04-29T14:53:32.000Z,Steve
PayPal is HORRIBLE!!   Call your congressperson!!,PayPal used to be decent but now they are absolutely horrible.   I tried to link some other accounts to my PayPal and UNLIKE other reputable institutions that link instantly they told me it could take up to a week to go through!   WOW.They won't even let you contact their corporate headquarters via phone you can only send them mail!   Why?   Because they are awful and greedy and hemorrhaging money from recent competition.What this scumbag institution is doing is hoping you will get frustrated and instead of transferring your money you will give up and leave it with their TRASH institution.Run away from this institution tell all your friends and your congressperson that this company needs to go out of business.,1,2023-04-29T01:54:29.000Z,Mark Nelson
PayPal holding funds from non-profit,"I am organizing a workshop for a nonprofit, and we set up a PayPal account to collect registrations fees from participants. PayPal shut down our account and did not give a reason-now they are holding $3000 in registration fees for 180 days. Unfortunately, our workshop is only 30 days away, so we will be very limited in what we can offer participants for their fees. Luckily we were able to set up an authorize.net account, which has worked just fine for remaining registrations. But I am extremely disappointed that we won’t be able to hold as nice of a workshop as we could have. Some of the fees could have gone to funding student’s travel to the workshop, but now that’s not an option. I will never use PayPal again, either for business or personal reasons.",1,2023-04-29T01:29:39.000Z,Clara Chew

If I could offer a ZERO star,"If I could offer a ZERO star, I would do it. We ordered wedding invitation cards by Paypal which costs us over £400. We received the wrong colour/design/material from the seller, we offered seller to send back stock to China under their cost and seller rejected. We opened a case on Paypal and requested for a refund with lots of evidence, pictures and conversation with seller. Paypal closed my case straight away, and said the wedding card we received isn't significant different. I don't know if you order a white wedding card and received a dark gold ugly wedding card... how come it is not a significantly different. We ordered white gold envelope and we received brown thin envelope, how come this is not a significantly different.

Case was closed 4 days early, and despite me being told to arrange a courier for which I incurred a cost, they are now saying I didn't provide tracking-I was told the receipt I had produced was sufficient.

Poor support responses,"I have been using PayPal for several years now, and unfortunately, I have had some negative experiences with their service. On the positive side, it is convenient to use PayPal for online purchases and transactions, and their buyer protection program can be helpful if there are any issues with a purchase.However, my main issue with PayPal is their customer service. I have had several instances where I needed assistance with an issue, but their customer service team was slow to respond and unhelpful when they did. This made resolving the issue a frustrating and time-consuming process.Additionally, I have had some issues with PayPal's fees and exchange rates. They often charge high fees for international transactions, and their exchange rates can be unfavorable compared to other options.Overall, while PayPal can be a convenient option for online transactions, their customer service and fees leave something to be desired. I would recommend exploring other payment options to ensure a better experience.",2,2023-04-27T09:31:30.000Z,Jason B

Terrible customer service and no loyalty,After more than 15 years using PayPal for online transactions I was informed by email that my account was closed due to inappropriate use with no explanation. I called customer service a number of times for an explanation why. They told me to read there terms and conditions. I still have no idea why they did this and I am appalled at the complete lack of loyalty and customer service. This happened nearly a year ago and I still cannot use my account but I am able to log on and see all my details including bank account details. I called customer service in regards to this and asked them to delete all my details they informed me that they can keep my details for at least 8 years and I should read the terms and conditions. With all the hacking of these platforms I am not happy about this. My advice to anyone thinking of using PayPal is don’t do it they are a law unto themselves. With all the other options available to pay online now days my advice is to look elseware. Terrible customer service and absolutely no loyalty at all.,1,2023-04-27T07:35:40.000Z,Chris

Paypal is doing nothing with scammers that are penetrating little ads websites, they do not investigate, they allow stolen money to flow and they don’t even blink an eye.

Occasionally Steals Your Money,"Overall great, occasionally steals your money (in my case almost 300 euros) and there is nothing you can do about it.I booked a hotel through booking.com, choose PayPal, and a payment in 30 days (Mistake 1). After I stayed in the hotel (read: received the service) and returned from my trip, I confirmed the payment. Funny story: PayPal booked my account twice.It took a while but I found where I can contact PayPal. No option for a double payment. Took the one - wrong amount - wrote what happened. Soon after I was contacted via messages and informed that it’s too complicated, I should call. Toll free number didn’t work. Paid line had a wonderful robot who kept asking me to press numbers, and I have to admit - I lost patience and wrote back that it’s upsetting that I have to call when they failed (mistake 2).Then - long story short - I contacted hotel (they have received only one payment), I opened a ticket with booking (no one contacted me directly), I opened two more tickets with PayPal and even when one was encouraging (I see your situation, I did what I could, you should get back your money etc style), both came back weeks later with a negative response. I provided all of the parties with bank statement, hotel receipt, PayPal history. The biggest mistake - only later I realized what the PayPal employees did: they flagged one payment. It went to booking, amount correct, date correct, I received the service, all good. No one flagged the double payment, no one asked why and how an identical amount can be booked from an account that had only one “Pay after 30 days” invoice. I don’t know what keeps them from booking the money triple times, at least now I’m informed there’s nothing one can do in these cases. They can and they take it.

If there was a zero I would use that…,"If there was a zero I would use that rating. Some years ago I had my PayPal account hacked by a Uber user in Russia, luckily I realised this had happened after the first trip and managed to get PayPal to cancel the Uber account. I then spent a considerable amount of time going between Uber and PayPal to issue a refund. I was quite cross at the time and thought of cancelling account then but continued to use my account as it was just a one off. However, after going through my recent pay in 3 transactions I noticed there had been one set up with a company I had never heard of, I googled the company and it just came up with scam/fraud reviews and quickly realised when I looked at the date that the order was placed on 26/08/22 and it was in dollars. I never order from outside the uk as I don’t trust them, and the 3 items had a phoney yodel tracking ref. I then realised that on that date I was in hospital in intensive care after suffering a cardiac arrest, how the hell would I have done this in an induced coma? I contacted PayPal and explained all of this and literally within a couple of hours I got an email to say that it was not an unauthorised transaction, I was in absolute shock, couldn’t believe the response from them. I then spoke to the fraud team at my bank on Friday and received the refund from them today as it was fraudulent. I just wanted to let other users of PayPal to be really cautious, I will be closing my account with them now as they cannot be trusted.

strongly caution against using PayPal,"I recently had an absolutely terrible experience with PayPal, and I would strongly advise anyone against using their services. After setting up a business account with PayPal, I was shocked to discover that they had placed a hold on my funds for 180 days without any valid reason.After the 180 days were up, I attempted to withdraw the funds to my bank account, only to find that PayPal continued to stall and delay the process. Despite multiple attempts to contact their customer support team and resolve the issue, I was repeatedly given the runaround and told to simply wait another 180 days.This experience has been incredibly frustrating and has caused significant financial hardship for my business. It is completely unacceptable for PayPal to withhold funds without valid reason and then refuse to release them even after the hold period has ended.Overall, I would strongly caution anyone against using PayPal for their business needs. Their lack of transparency and unwillingness to provide satisfactory customer support has left me feeling completely let down and frustrated. I would strongly recommend exploring other payment processing options that prioritize customer satisfaction and fairness.",1,2023-04-24T19:15:21.000Z,Tawfik Dukhan

Charged me a miscellaneous charge…,"Back in March 2023 I made a $245 payment to cover promotional interest free purchases. Since PayPal no longer disburses any part of your payment to promo charges, all of my payment went to the non promo balance. A customer rep told me I had to call to request to get the disbursements. So, I called. The payment was disbursed except for .31 cents. I made ANOTHER payment, called AGAIN to request that part of the payment should take care of the .31 cent. The very next day I am charged a miscellaneous payment of $244.69. I called to ask what the charge is; I did not make a charge for that amount.  They told me fraud had been committed; deactivated my account, and gave me a new number. I just got off the phone with a rep. PayPal recharges you the amount you ask to allocate to promo charges because all payments automatically go to standard balances. They basically negated my payment. None of this makes sense. So now there’s a miscellaneous charge that is gathering interest. You are punished if you take advantage of their promotional hoodwinking and punished even more if you want to pay the promo charges off early. PRETTY MUCH DONE WITH SYNCHRONY BANK WHO HAS TAKEN OVER PAYPAL. PAYPAL/SYNCHRONY BANK IS THE EPITOME OF GREED. Not worth the stress! Started using AfterPay! Much better experience! Paying off PayPal and closing my account. I’m not letting the $244.69 go - I know that’s what PP wants me to do, but that’s not happening.",1,2023-04-21T02:14:43.000Z,Rogue Librarian
"No Protection, No Insight, No Data","I always used Paypal for my online purchases - even after they changed their backend to require me to get their credit card in order to charge against my balance, instead of my bank - but I still used them because they protected me against scams. Or at least I thought so. But when I finally got scammed for $68.22 - ZERO protection. All PP says for that transaction is ""Bank Account"" - they have NO record of who the scammer was nor where they are. The scammers are getting away with everything by using Paypal and PP is NOT protecting us. I've written to Paypal over the last few weeks to request the ""evidence"" used for the claim and - nothing. They say the transaction matches my other transactions so they see no scam which is BS. They can't even give me the company name behind this scam!So, if your a scammer - use Paypal! They won't come after you at all! They won't report you. They won't identify you to the customers... it's a great service - for scammers...",1,2023-04-20T19:47:07.000Z,Janit Calvo

Client service is as good as non existent and I wanted to remove my existing account after struggling for months to get it active again. This is also as good as impossible since they do not allow me to remove my account until it is “not restricted” anymore. On top of this entire situation (which was the last drop) this is not the first, second or even third issue I’ve had with PayPal.

I cannot even believe them...I have…,"I cannot even believe them...I have used paypal off and on for many years and had slight problems before but this time a they supported a scam company against me! In 2020 I briefly used an antivirus tool that I paid for using paypal. I cancelled the service and the virus tool did not seem to work anyways (Total AV). The following year they did not charge me anything since I had cancelled 11 months earlier. Then in 2022 they charged me suddenly 160 dollars with a made up annual plan that I have never signed and that they could not prove in any court. And this is several credit cards later...would never happen with my regular bank. But I selldom use paypal so I did not even see it. Now I happened to log in a few days ago to see that a monthly donation is still on but they had cancelled the donation but agreed to having Total AV charge my account 2 years in a row. I made a complaint and thought everything would be solved at least this year since it was only 3 days after they charged me. I also called in to customer service on the 11:th to see how it was going and they told me to just wait and see. So I called again today and now they said that I hadn´t answered a mail that they sent before the 11:th so they had closed my complaint and it was impossible to make another one. So the complaint was from the 7:th to the 14:th, so seven days and because I did not see their mail they refuse to help me and shut everything down after only seven days, knowing that this other Total AV is a scam party and believing everything I told them. The customer service was also rude the last time and almost started yelling because I questioned their methods. So if you did not know Paypal 100 procent supports scam artist and poor peole like me who struggle every month to make ends meet will have to pay these scam artists.

TOO CHEAP to provide a debit card to avoid having ridiculous fees seeing that they value their small businesses and u would think want to help give them reasons to stay but I'm still not eligible and sorry but because I'm getting higher fees having to transfer because I can't use my account with a card number is stupid and totally makes your entire companies whole reason for really being best for sending and receiving money because it's limited from back 10 years ago and that's the only way you actually were better and more appealing than Cash app now might as well rebrand and try actually caring for customers instead of money and give us value that and stop being cheap giving me reason to avoid using account since I got a card on Cash app plus cheaper oh and you can actually send message for help after-hours with your useless automated robot that is annoying and helps with one issue majority you are screwed until open. The debit card and robot bs being so annoying just to try asking questions to see when I'm going to have enough for a debit card cause no more than 2 more and if you still fail tremendously and I don't get a debit card I'll only use the PayPal account for companies I get paid fast and I will not give y'all a chance ever if I do turn my back. Y'all forgot who your company is and the main point that made y'all best now id consider closing my doors cause your platforms board line useless and no debit card gives me reason to use less not more for one. If you value your business you would still give them for ease and proving you want us to stay all your doing right now is giving me a headache making everything such a freaking issue and so much more difficult than it needs if you want to keep my business. Shouldn't need a migraine pill every time I exit my account it's so ridiculous I'm completely and utterly disappointed and I would give 0 stars if it was an option.

PayPal don't care and won't help you!,"PayPal claim to offer protection to buyers but this could not be further from the truth. I bought an item from eBay that turned out to be faulty as soon as it was fitted to my wife's car. Unfortunately, there had been a delay of 6 weeks between buying the item and having it fitted which put it outside the eBay buyers guarantee period and the seller refused to refund me instead offering a replacement part which I refused as it was a poorly manufactured pattern car part and I had zero faith in a replacement being any better. I had already spent £120 which I could not recover, having the faulty part fitted and then removed from the vehicle so I was not prepared to take a gamble on a second one. As I had used PayPal to buy the item I thought, brilliant, they'll help me as that's the whole point of using them, to resolve issues like this. I contacted PayPal who logged my complaint and predicted a 3 week timescale to get the matter sorted. I heard NOTHING from PayPal and had to keep messaging them but still got zero response. Eventually I was told to return the item and they would refund me when the seller acknowledged receipt of the item. The item being expensive and heavy, was not something I was prepared to send back to the seller at further cost to myself and I told PayPal that I would like the seller to arrange collection of the item and refund me instead. Again, weeks passed by without any contact from PayPal so I checked my account and found my case had been closed and claim rejected as I had not returned the item. I had sent several messages to PayPal explaining my situation and what I was looking for to resolve the issue but apparently they are not interested and didn't bother to read them or contact me to discuss it. I complained to PayPal and filled in a satisfaction survey giving them a full breakdown of my experience but they haven't bothered to reply.I will NEVER use PayPal again, they're a total con and offer zero help, support or protection when you need it.",1,2023-04-12T19:33:01.000Z,David Cain

It’s not just one or two occasions things go wrong it’s a constant issue.   If I ever do get logged back in which I doubt will be any time soon , I will be closing the account . Much easier ways of managing money out there without the hassle of a service that is constantly not fit for purpose.   These cowboys contacted me through their so called verification app to request the old email , after confirming the old email, even though it’s no longer in use , they said yes there was another account with the old email I gave them , then they asked through their so called secure chat service could they give me a quick call on the number I provided. I agreed . I then got another message through their so called secure messaging service they had attempted to call but got no answer . I once again sent verified the number , they never called . I called them to get both accounts closed , I was informed they would never ring me or ask if they could and yet there it is on the so called safe verified customer service app message centre . So what’s going on there then?  They say it’s a secure system as you are sent a code to verify before having acess to the account . NEW CUSTOMERS BEWARE . They are employing people who misuse your account details then according to that . The woman was blatant they would not conduct business this way so there’s something dodgy somewhere.

I never pushed Send bc it was the wrong Acct. Their reps & even Supervisors don’t know “how” to assist. No one was rude, but they certainly weren’t professional or helpful.

Utterly Disappointed with PayPal's Arbitrary Decision - Unfair Treatment for My Business,"As a small business owner, I am always on the lookout for reliable and efficient payment processing services. I had been using PayPal for years, and it was an integral part of my business operations. However, recently, I was dealt a heavy blow when PayPal permanently suspended my account without any warning or a valid reason.They claimed that my business was ""too risky"" to continue using their services. This accusation came as a shock to me, as I had been using other payment providers as well, and none of them raised any issues. I take pride in maintaining a healthy relationship with my customers, and my dispute rate is at a mere 0.2%. This is well below industry standards and a testament to my commitment to providing quality products and services.Despite my attempts to communicate with PayPal and clarify this misunderstanding, I was met with canned responses and a complete lack of empathy. Their customer support was abysmal and unhelpful, showing no regard for the damage this unjust suspension caused to my business.PayPal's decision to suspend my account without giving me a chance to defend my business practices is nothing short of a travesty. It's frustrating to see such a well-known company exhibit such a lack of professionalism and utter disregard for their long-standing customers.I am incredibly disappointed with PayPal and urge fellow business owners to consider alternative payment providers that treat their customers with respect and fairness. My experience with PayPal has left a bitter taste in my mouth, and I will be taking my business elsewhere.In summary, I cannot recommend PayPal for any business owners due to their arbitrary decision-making and terrible customer support.

DO NOT TRUST PAYPAL,"I received a payment from one of my customers who is a California licensed realtor. PayPal accepted the payment on 4/4/23 @ 230pm. They sent a receipt of payment to me & my customer. PayPal did not post the payment to my account as they usually do. I contacted PayPal to inquire about the payment. I was informed that the payment was under a compliance audit & the payment wouldn't be posted for 72 hrs. I called back on the morning of day 3 & was told to call back in 2hrs because it hadn't been a full 72hrs. I called back exactly at the 72hr. mark. I was informed by a supervisor named Adrian that I was mislead/lied to about the payment release time. There is actually NO exact time when the payment would be released. PayPal collected money for my company, the transaction cleared, & PayPal is refusing to release my funds. All of the staff at PayPal have alluded that something was suspicious about my client & that was the reason the funds haven't been released. It sounds like PayPal is discriminating against my client who is Muslim! I gave PayPal all of the information that would support our transaction & the information is also listed on the invoice sent to my client. PayPal is still refusing to release my funds & there is NO expected date when those funds will be available to me. Adrian the supervisor stated that the reason they won't release my payment is because they cannot verify the address of my customer.  When I look at the invoice not only is his address  on the invoice there it also has a green check mark by the address that says confirmed. Paypal is refusing to release my funds & now they won't provide a refund either. They are making me wait an additional 72 business hours which translates into 6 days because today is Friday. I have been informed that if they choose not to provide a refund that they can keep it indefinitely. I requested to speak to a higher authority & was left on hold with No response. Not only is this DISCRIMINATION, it also a crime.",1,2023-04-08T02:28:34.000Z,DIGITAL IMAGERY

Disappointing experience with PayPal,"I've been using PayPal for quite some time now for my business transactions, but recently I faced a very disappointing and frustrating experience. My company, Hybrid Hosting, had its account terminated by PayPal without any prior notice or explanation. We tried our best to negotiate with them, but they were unresponsive and unwilling to work with us to resolve the issue.This situation forced us to look for alternative payment gateways and caused a significant inconvenience to our customers. Moreover, we have been left with no choice but to explore legal actions against PayPal to address this matter. Their lack of transparency and uncooperative attitude has left us extremely dissatisfied and questioning their commitment to customer satisfaction.In summary, I'm very disappointed with PayPal's handling of our situation, and I cannot recommend their services to other businesses. Be cautious when using PayPal, as they may leave you in a difficult position without any warning or assistance.",1,2023-04-07T20:54:47.000Z,AI Central

When I did finally get through to somebody they tried to push blame elsewhere... It took a long time before they admitted they were at fault... I was told there would be no charges for a late fee (too right! I actually had to push them for this) Got transferred to the ""Credit Team"" at this point to smooth everything over... They wanted to set up a BRAND NEW credit agreement... Baffled at this point to be honest... As well as most displeased as you can imagine... Kept re assuring be I wouldn't be charged any late fees... Got an email today informing me of a late fee... Will be taking legal action soon if not rectified.I will also be looking into cancelling the entire thing and going with Samsung direct.

Bad choice,"In short, PayPal is a bad choice. The platform is unnecessarily complicated and creates a lot of headaches. Reporting a problem or resolving an issue is troublesome.  Customer service is unreachable, leaving you trapped and frustrated, waiting for their action, which comes normally after unjustifiable very long time. Any small business has live chat for support but PayPal is offering you a limited list of enquirers and if you did not find what you are looking for, they refer you to their community!!!The fees are not only overpriced but also not being informed upfront. I'm waiting to use up my remaining balance and I will shut my account for good.",1,2023-03-30T21:42:14.000Z,Basem

A few years back I changed the credit card payment gateway and stopped using them. I kept my account opened just stopped using their service for about 5 years.Recently, I reinstated my payment processing with PayPal and did a few sales totaling about $7000. I was then told the funds are withheld for 21 days. This should have been clearly explained before I reinstated the account. As a business owner, we need to have the funds available in a reasonable time otherwise it's difficult to fulfill orders. Paypal is not a a viable solution for my business.

WHO DOSE PAYPAL THINK THEY ARE,"PAYPAL HAS HELD MY DIRECT DEPOSITS OF 7,004.97 FOR 2 YEARS AND THEY ARE STILL HOLDING MY MONEY! I opened a PayPal account to receive my direct deposits. WORST MISTAKE EVER! I have a really hard time remembering things and so if I can't remember a password I'll just make up a new account (very bad habit I know). I set up the account had a couple thousand dollars deposited spent my money as I needed to. Then I was robbed my purse was stolen my phone was in it. So I lost everything, and eventually my home, my job, my vehicle. I had no ID no documents to prove who I was, no family or friends to speak of my best friend and advisor my mother had just past and I was a mess over that fact alone. I didn't know how to go about trying to reclaim my life or even if I wanted to. I didn't even know how I was going to find a place to sleep ( motel's don't allow you to get a room without Identification) or eat much less shower and dress for work everyday. I had money in my Paypal account I knew because that's where my direct deposits were being sent. I no longer had the debit card as it was in my wallet (stolen). I couldn't remember the email address I had used when I opened the account and shortly before opening the account I had purchased a new phone,with a brand new PHONE NUMBER So now I can't even access much less find my Paypal account. I was so consumed with my survival needs that I simply couldn't be bothered with trying to get Paypal to help me find my account. By the time I put my deposits on hold I had received 7,004.97 in additional deposits. So now I'm homeless, scared, clueless and broken. I figure out how to get my documents together and reclaim my life or at least my identity. I got another job still struggling to secure affordable permanent housing. IM GETTING BY BARELY. So the only way I see to move to more affordable housing and get a vehicle and be able to save money in case of tragically unforseen life altering catastrophes, is to find the PayPal account. So my hunt begins. It is a never ending, exhausting and extremely frustrating journey. PayPal is useless as useless could be. In assisting me. They claimed they couldn't look up the account with my social security number, my name or any other information I had to give. Only the email address or phone number. So I became a detective. I found the Facebook account I had when I opened the account and saw witch picture I was using at that time. I searched the PayPal app and Google daily trying to understand as much about them as I could. Then one day I put in the right/wrong way to spell my name Bingo so I had the cash tag. Paypal continued to say they couldn't help me or use there own issuing tag to find my account. I contiued to search eventually paying for the trial service of speoko witch pulled up every phone number and email address I've ever had. I received help from a very limited few at Paypal like 3 people to be EXCAT they allowed me to send lists of possible email addresses and they would run a check on them to find out if any of them had my deposits. So the day I found my account I WAS BEYOND ECSTATIC I WAS SO HAPPY SO EXCITED. 2 YRS  from last dep. Little did I know my nightmare had only began. I can now SEE THE THOUSANDS SITTING THERE STARING BK AT ME AND CANT USE THEM. Needing things like rent money on short weeks and the fear of being told to leave again with that money sitting there is another level of FRUSTRATION ITS INFURIATING. So I start the updates witch I knew nothing about. Or  PayPal's rules or security. I was trusting that were telling me the correct procedures. They're paypal, A mutibillion dollar company.The customer service people are very unprofessional. They're RUDE, HAVEN'T A CLUE WHAT IS GOING ON, they've HUNG UP ON ME MULTIPLE TIMES, HAVEN'T ANY COMMUNICATION SKILLS WITH EACH OTHER, AND REFUSE TO LISTEN THAT I MIGHT KNOW WHAT IM SPEAKING ON. So after every single update starting with my email. It's Wait 48 hrs can't access account. It's my fault to many changes an attempts now it's my name I try to get them to let me send documents to prove I'm me they don't need them. Baffling wait 48 hrs. Phone number update 72 hrs. I'm able to add my cards. Can't transfer my money or request a check. But it's Progressing now needs to be verified. Waiting again. I'm able to send 0.01 to someone. Now everything needed to be confirmed.They did these confirmations one at a time. I've only been able to transfer 704.97 and now the account is blocked again. Another 4 to 5 days is what I'm told. I still can't log in on the website. Only in the app. I feel they are playing with me TORTURING ME. IM TIRED OF THE GAMES. I NEED A LAWYER AT THIS POINT! ITS BEEN NOTHING BUT ISSUES AND LIES. SO if life happens YOU CANT COUNT ON PAYPAL. THEY REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THERE RESPONSIBILITY AS BUSINESS OWNERS TO HELP THEIR CUSTOMERS FORGET ABOUT CUSTOMERS BEING RIGHT OR HAPPY!

I reopened the dispute, and even provided a direct link to the page with the tracking info. And again, PayPal said that the tracking was invalid and closed it again. I was at a loss, PayPal was simply gaslighting me.

"Shocking, avoid dealing with them at all costs!!!","Purchased a camera online for my daughters birthday from what I thought looked like a reputable store.Maybe naive of me however I always thought that when purchasing through Paypal there was some kind of vetting of the seller that had a taken place beforehand which gave me some kind of additional comfort. Soon after purchasing I received zero confirmation of the transaction or tracking details etc.Upon further investigation I found that the trading name of the seller was “Donkey International Trading Limited’ ….hardly a name I’d associate with an online seller of photographic equipment.I called and emailed the contacts on the website and got zero reply….clearly all fake. I then raised this with PayPal and created a complaint. After a couple of weeks I received a reply back saying that the seller had provided a FedEx Tracking number (funny that Paypal managed to get a response but I didn’t) Clearly this tactic is designed to keep Paypal ‘happy’ by giving the illusion that everything is above board but clearly it isn’t the case as the tracking message stated that the package had been delivered however not only did it not contain a delivery address but was also signed by a name completely different to mine!  So guess the result of the complaint……wait for it?…..”WE’VE REVIEWED THE TRANSACTION AND ARE REFUSING YOUR CLAIM BECAUSE THE ITEM WAS DELIVERED AND SIGNED FOR.WE ARE SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE THAT YOU MAY HAVE ENCOUNTERED WITH THIS TRANSACTION!!!!!Seriously PayPal is this the best you can do….this has to be the simplest trick in the book, sell a non existent item, accept the money, ignore the customer but then say the items was delivered without giving an address but quoting a name of the person that signed for it that is not the name of the customer that ordered the item or anyone that lives at the address.

Bought shoelaces, but I didn't received the same colour I ordered. Because I purchased from the US and I'm living in the UK they wasn't up to exchange due to the high postage prices. I contacted the PayPal, they sent trough my complain to the seller, but they just ignored me. After a few e-mails so the PayPal did. I didn't received refund, neither exchange. PayPal just closed the conversations without any positive results for me. Then I suspended my account. I said I never gonna shopping with them.Unfortunately I had an online purchase which asked me to have a PayPal account. So I created an another one. I made that shopping, I said that I will suspend again after that again. Well, I didn't. My partner started to sell my kids old lego collections on the Facebook market. We sold 3 items more than half year ago. We sent trough post the Lego, they paid trough PayPal. My partner kept the postage slip for a few month then she thrown to the bin as we didn't have any complain. We sold quite a few things on facebook before and had 100% satisfactions all the time.Last week, the PayPal frozen my account. They said that because of a complain. Well, we didn't receive any information about it. They didn't tell me which customer complained, we didn't receive any feedback nor from the Facebook, neither from PayPal. I called them to refund me my money balance, but they said that they will just after 180 days. So no Lego and no money either.These people are criminals!

I called paypal and after taking forever to get through their horrible phone tree of b.s. options that make no sense I finally spoke with a representative who told me that because I didn't pay for the extra paypal insurance and because I don't have an account (they couldn't figure out how to give me one) they will not dispute the person who has sent me 3 bogus emails and fake tracking numbers through paypal.  They say it's up to me to call my bank to make the dispute even though the scammer is working through their paypal platform.  Paypal takes no responsibility for these people who rip people off.  A similar thing happened to my husband recently through paypal.  Paypal is becoming a platform for scammers and they are happy to accomodate because they don't really care about their customers.,1,2023-03-25T23:55:39.000Z,Gudrun Welder Conspire To Heal
Avoid if you can!!!,Closed my account with them. Thanks for this stupid institution I've lost the purchase I've been working on for s really long time. I've spent a lot of time and effort to convince the seller to ship over the goods from US to UK and in the end PayPal app decided to provide non existing shipping address (not the one I've chosen). Support team is so incompetent that first person I've spoke to said that they deal with transactions only and don't provide any shipping address (complete nonsense). The second one decided to switch me over to the supervisor who said that PayPal mistake is my fault and declined to send me over the email (or any proof) clearly confirming his statement....AVOID IF YOU CAN!!!!,1,2023-03-25T21:00:38.000Z,Karol Beczek

Cant transfer or use his money either. Gave up then, given up now.  Not possible to contact Pay Pal, Closed on a Saturday. Tried phoning....waste of time.

As a business owner, they have taken away food from my family and workers by not releasing funds that are rightly due to me.  The customer support is awful, We barely receive responses with feedback, but rather acknowledgement of emails received. I am exhausted after running after them.

Cyber security is absent,"Cyber security is absent.  They allowed someone to easily run a repeating fraud charge on my accounts.  The transactions even had a repeating value!  Their cyber security is clearly lacking if they cannot detect repeating values that happen in short sequence like this.So I call customer service, and they read me a script that claims security will be better and it won't happen again.  Then they locked my account so I could 'secure it'.  Basically, a password reset was how the CSR tried to fix my concern, when I wanted them to investigate how their software was vulnerable to a fraudulent repeating transaction.  The CSR then hung up on me.  So.. I call back.  The CSR who answered this time pretended they couldn't hear me on the phone.  So they hang up on me too.  Then, the first CSR calls back, and leaves me a voicemail that claims we got disconnected, AND that she couldn't hear me.  So.. was it a disconnection, or no audio in the call?  These stories conflict, and it tells me that the PayPal customer service reps use these tactics to end calls that they don't want to deal with.  In conclusion, PayPal staffs deceitful customer service reps, who are only there to try and placate customers by reading a script.  There was zero concern about how their cyber security was bypassed by a repeating fraudulent transaction.Do not save your personal info with PayPal.

To be specific, the order was purchased from AliExpress, it was the first time I buy from this website which is a total mess, they are slow, the sellers never respond, the customer service always say they will help that they treat you like god when it’s the contrary, they never solve anything! They even can’t speak or understand English well，they do no care if you get the products or not, they just care to steal your money. I thought PayPal will be responding my claim because that was the reason I used it, but I’m very surprised that they are doing anything possible to not respond the my lose. It’s a really ridiculous and exhausted process just for $10.00. My conclusion is, I’ll must avoid PayPal from now on and use another payment method.

Not even a week after that, PayPal simply emailed me about suspending my account permanently, giving me no other context than ""The account violated..."" this and that.I have been trying to reach PayPal for more information about it, but nothing worked, no further context available. I am stuck with a permanently limited, useless account which I don't even have the right to delete myself.Thank you very much, PayPal.

I wish I had come here before using…,"I wish I had come here before using PayPal to invoice for my latest service job. It was for $2,300, a small amount, but evidently big enough to alert their ridiculous protection of holding my money for 21 days. The two methods for getting the funds released were bogus since there wasn't a physical package that was shipped. After begging the customer to scavenge for a 'confirm receipt' button, which was not where they said it should be, he finally found it and confirmed receipt, triggering the release.This is in now way how a business should be conducted. I was an early adopter of PayPal when I thought it was an innovative way to get beyond the credit card monopoly. Now I wouldn't wish doing business with this company on my worst enemies. Scam city. Stay far away.",1,2023-03-19T01:29:17.000Z,Er Mo
Terrible customer service,"PayPal used to be great, now there's absolutely no protection whatsoever for buyers. I had a pair of trainers turn up that were the wrong size to what was advertised, and PayPal rejected that claim because apparently despite the fact they don't fit they aren't  'significantly different to what was sold'. They also then completely ignored my subsequent two requests for an appeal, not replying to my emails at all. More recently, I bought a gift set that was meant to contain a book and didn't, and that claim was also rejected because it apparently wasn't covered. PayPals buyer protection used to be one of its biggest selling points, but I see no use in using them now. Hopefully with losing the relationship with eBay and their massive stock market crash last year they won't be around for long.",1,2023-03-18T22:22:47.000Z,Lauren

Non Exustent Customer Service,Horrific Customer ServiceTheir App is all about avoiding human interaction on their part.  I raised a legitimate complaint back in the beginning of February.   They were initially obstructive but eventually upheld my complaint. During that time there was a payment due to go out on my PayPal Credit Account.  At the time of the complaint they stopped my direct debit and the February payment didn’t go out. I wasn’t aware of this until 3rd March when I immediately reinstated. I found out on 12 March that they placed a missed payment marker on my credit record.   This was a matter totally out of my control and completely in the control of PayPal. When I raised this on Sunday the agent came back and said he could see what had gone wrong and will get his manager to remove the marker. On Tuesday I got a message from a manager saying that this was normal practice and that the marker would not be removed. I hadn’t done anything wrong.I rang and asked to speak to a manager and told that one would call back that day. No manager called back and upon calling them today told that I would have to wait 5-7 working days. This is clearly how seriously PayPal don’t take customer service and that their management think their time is more important than their customers. Ive been with them 20 years.  Their customer service standards are now the lowest they have been in all that time. Illusive managers and staff tgat are not capable of answering simple questions. Time to find another payment service.,1,2023-03-17T13:18:53.000Z,Steve Dauwalder
Absolutely disgusting service,Absolutely disgusting service.  I bought a pair of boots that developed a fault after one month of wear.  Out of eBay 30 days so I raised a customer protection dispute with PayPal. I lost the case as I’d worn the boots!   They only cover faulty items that haven’t been used WTH!  I argued under the 2015 consumer law that I was entitled to a refund as the boots hadn’t lasted a reasonable amount of time.  Their reply was “that isn’t in our jurisdiction and you’ll have to take to court yourself “ I got nowhere and felt totally let down. The agent spoke to me like a child and was very patronising!  I will never use them again and my biggest mistake was not having my credit card linked to them otherwise I could have taken up the case with my credit card!I would never recommend them they don’t offer buyer protection that’s total rubbish.  They don’t even reply to the complaints on here.  I’d give them 0 stars if I could.  I’m £55 out of pocket thanks to them !,1,2023-03-17T09:11:55.000Z,Jacqueline

Absolute scammers,Absolute scammers. I HAD been a member for years until a contractor who was out of town needed cabinets in a house in a rush to get a final draw and pay all the subs. We went with Paypal believing it was a safe way to pay via credit card. PayPal not only held the funds for 21 days but also kept $1200 of the money! As a professional with a solid reputation AND a single parent I was forced to pay the difference from our savings account AND offended the other tradesmen who were waiting to get paid!

And refused to put me in touch with anyone else and proceeded to tell me there was nothing she could do to fix my account or let me speak to anyone other than her.  PayPal . You suck! I hate using this app for any reason.  Not only have I verified my identity several times through the people working for the customer service department, but I cannot understand them very well either due to their extreme accents which makes it very hard to understand what they are even saying.  I have had my account since 2017 and never had any issues with anything negative, yet.. security issues keep me from being able to use my funds because it wont accept a phone number already added to my account and verified by PayPal. Therefore . I believe I am going to cancel my account and can it and go to cash app or Venmo.. or any other app but PayPal because they are incompetent.. untrustworthy and I can't use the funds in my account anyway so you may as well say they're just stealing the money in it because I cannot do anything with it at all . I can't transfer it.. spend it.. nothing! PayPal you get a flat ZERO star rating from me for several reasons!!

IAPWE has a lot of negative feedback Online and on the BBB. I didn't join their organization. IAPWE agreed to refund the money. They created a live check in February without my permission. My credit union told me to resolve it with Paypal. IAPWE stole more money from me at the beginning of March. I contacted PayPal and IAPWE. After three messages to IAPWE, they agreed to a refund. A representative at PayPal named Jessa told me I would get a refund for the February payment but the Disputes department e-mailed me and said that I wouldn't get a refund. PayPal tells lies. I even sent them the e-mail from IAPWE indicating that the  refund was approved. I made several phone calls to PayPal. I just tried to close my account on their website but it wouldn't let me.

NOT In Business for YOU!!,"I have been a user of Paypal for about 20 years and they STARTED OUT as the buyers ""friend"" in the difficult online sales environment by keeping your credit card data off the internet AND helping you with diputes. However, it seems NOW that they have BECOME THE SCAM SELLERS friend-NOT YOURS. In the PAST, I could dispute purchases where the seller was a SCAM or sent the wrong/cheap item (usually from CHINA). It is VERY HARD to figure out which Internet sellers are from China since many now have UNITED STATES ADDRESSES. However it is very easy to know once you receive something that you did not order (like a cheap $1 oven mitt after I ordered expensive Bat guano fertilizer for my fruit trees). Most recently I have had 2 SCAM Companies ( Kalesafe.com and a Florida company that advertises all sorts of household items, but is based in CHINA and does not send what you order- Again USA ADDRESS, but based in China. In BOTH Of these recent cases, Paypal was NO HELP and actually sent me BACK TO SCAM SELLERS (even after the scam sellers refused to help me via email). Luckily, I have a good credit card company who let me dispute purchases and credited my account as they ""investigated"" BOTH disputes of wrong/cheap Items.DO NOT USE OR TRUST PAYPAL. They are no longer there to HELP YOU. They only want the MONEY SCAMMED BY BOGUS SELLERS (mostly from CHINA).

"DON'T use paypal, choose others! PayPal always disappoints!","How can such a huge ""business entity"" be so customer unfriendly? PayPal is one of the worst ever companies that provide any form of intelligent informed or easily accessed customer service! Their computerized phone system makes it pretty much impossible to get anyone to help. The customer service employees reply with answers that are pretty much as inaccurate as the computerized phone and online help assistant. I have fought unsuccessfully with PayPal for about a month and still my problems were never fixed, never correctly or intelligently addressed, always blamed to be something other than PayPals glitch, which it is; Paypal ignored my preferred payment choices and choose their own without informing me or allowing me to approve or deny. They have cost me endless amount of time, anger, stress and financial loses in various transactions. Without my permission they have sent a charge to my $0 balance bank account. I have a late rent payment out there floating around with extra late fees now because they did not allow a usual and often long time performed transfer of funds this month saying what I was requesting was a security risk which I fought unsuccessfully. I was to my son with the same last name even. They ended up doing the pymt as a check after a few denials but never told me they were doing a check, never gave me the option to cancel and deny and if they did I could have gotten the cash and paid it right away! They won't remove a very old mastercard from my acct. They won't link & allow me to use a new mastercard which I've set as my preferred pymt method. They ignore it an choose on their own without notification a different way to charge my purchases. I'm losing 1% cashback due to their errors & I can't get it fixed with them.

I even tried to submit a complaint but after typing it all out, their site keeps saying ""error"" - how very convenient.So I just got scammed - and then got scammed again because a seller can send any old tracking number and paypal will accept it as ""proof"".I've used paypal for many years and this is the first time I've had to ask for help and have been treated like garbage.  How the hell can any company accept ""tracking"" information when it's for an entirely different item to an entirely different town - and then they lie about having the ability to appeal their ludicrous decision.My advice - do not use Paypal - they pretend to look at complaints but clearly pay no attention at all.Update - I submitted a complaint using Paypal's online form.  They've not acknowledge it, I have no way of proving it was sent and they are completely ignoring it.   You can see why they are losing customers - they are protecting scammers and treating customers like garbage.   FIND A SAFE WAY TO PAY - PAYPAL'S PAYMENT PROTECTION IS COMPLETELY FAKE.",1,2023-03-10T23:13:04.000Z,pengipete
Fake online retailer used PayPal to…,"Fake online retailer used PayPal to scam me of over $100. when I opened a dispute PayPal they said they wouldn’t do anything because the transaction was processed as a personal transfer not a purchase so it wasn’t eligible for liability coverage. They allowed the seller to make the transaction a personal transfer without my knowledge (personal transfers are not allowed to be used to purchase goods or services per their rules) but even though they allowed it and didn’t let me know beforehand that this was how the transaction was being completed, they won’t cover it or even recognize that the seller is fraudulent. DO NOT USE PAYPAL if you are hoping they will make your purchase more secure— they won’t cover you even if the seller is breaking their rules and using personal transfers for a purchase!!! They even went so far to blame me for being responsible for initiating the transaction and so therefore it wasn’t their problem.",1,2023-03-06T03:09:54.000Z,Benjamin Monson

So I called them, first rep hung up on me while I was trying to explain, I called again explaining to a lady what happened and yes, I was not happy but told them nothing was directed at them, I didn't curse at them or become obnoxious at all... they say they record these messages but I doubt that will matter. then second lady hung up on me.

"Paypal investigations team are AWFUL, and BANNED MY ACCOUNT DESPITE ME BEING THE VICTIM!!!","I am so frustrated, annoyed and angry! After using a PayPal account with no issues, I get an email stating my account is going to be permanently limited for sale of goods which were against the PayPal guild lines. This was all a shock to me and came to me by suprise. So I did as any person would do, and contacted PayPal about this. They advised me first that I couldn’t appeal this decision, DESPITE THE EMAIL STATING I HAVE A RIGHT TO APPEAL! I then got off the phone with the terrible customer service lady who clearly didn’t want to help and called again hoping to get through to someone else. I managed to get through to a gentleman who was a bit better and actually looked at what was sent to me and realised I am allowed to appeal, so he went ahead and raised an appeal for me as PayPal had permanently banned me for something that I didn’t do. I explained to them that I have kept paypal in the loop at all times and I have always made it clear that they are always free to contact me should they need to speak with me but I never received any contact prior to the email to let me know what was going on. The appeal came back as a decision that they were sticking to the ban and not going to reverse this. I called up again to rest my case stating that I am more then willing to provide any information they require from me and more importantly, requesting WHY I got banned. They couldn’t give me a definitive answer which clearly states they don’t even know why I am getting banned! How can they ban me without any reasonable explanation?! They stating that it was due to sale/purchase of “counterfeit items”. This was due to a purchase I made and when I received the item from the seller, it was clearly a counterfeit product. So luckily I was backed by PayPal goods and services and kept PayPal in the loop of this. I was clearly the victim as I had been scammed but PayPal still put the blame on me rather then the seller who sold me counterfeit goods which is 100% illegal. This is not my fault if someone sells me counterfeit goods despite me assuming I was purchasing an authentic product. I am very frustrated and will be contacting PayPal again to try and get this resolved. PAYPAL ARE PUNISHING ME FOR BEING A VICTIM!!! How can PayPal ban me from being the victim?! I have always been more then willing to cooperate with them but I will be raising a complaint as PayPal is important for my day-to-day life and I shouldn’t be punished for being the victim of being scammed!!",1,2023-03-05T14:52:16.000Z,shahzaib.nasser

Jobless job seeker here screwed over by paypal security hold,"Jobless job seeker here. Trying to learn and self educated and step up. I do some contract work here and there and the companies I deal with pay me via paypal only sadly I get no choice. Tried to buy an ebook from a legitimate authority educational source and decided to use paypal funds I had and charge the rest to credit card to save on the squeeze I have. What does paypal do? Instantly charges my credit card for the remainder of balance, takes out my funds out of paypal account. And does not give it to the seller. Here I was on a weekend of driving and wanting to listen to the audio book as I drove and some paypal CXO probably chief legal counsel's horrible policy of a lottery of a random security check screws up my life. Now I have to go over my credit card balance to redo the transaction until 21 days potentially passes and paypal settles, processes or denies the transaction and I get my money back.

"Outdated, clunky and extortionate fees","The mobile version of the app is outdated, clunky, bug ridden and prone to frequent crashes. Beyond that, the user interface is quite frankly a relic - too many pages/tabs with very little data.

How can you justify that? It's a shame as what was known to be a reliable payment service is now a former shadow of itself.

Beware,"Beware, this company has severe glitches in their system and they won't admit fault or process refunds regardless. For example, auto-pay is not reliable, you're hit with a late fee and then they close your account after one incident. Why do they have to take such extreme measures? Called our bank and said it's all good on their end and didn't receive any request for payment from PayPal's auto-pay services. This happened 3x in a row, so we just took it off auto-pay and remind ourselves to do it manually every month. Such a pain. Another incident happened today, where money was taken out from another credit card instead of the defaulted credit card. I asked how this happened, if there was glitch. No apologies, was told that it goes to PayPal balance first then to the backup card. Well, it didn't go to the backup card, still wouldn't admit guilt or apologize, they just kept repeating that payments cannot be reversed. Why and how are these people still in business?

PayPal is getting worse over time...,"I had been using my PayPal account for years with no issues. I mostly used my account to pay for stuff online and to receive money which I would then withdraw to one of my Bank accounts. My PayPal account was fully verified with 2 Bank Accounts and 2 Debit Cards added. One random day PayPal just sent me an email saying they had limited my account. I couldn't send or receive money. And no I didn't violate any of their policies in any way. In fact during the time they limited my account, I barely used my PayPal anymore. I mostly used it to receive money from the same companies that had been sending me monthly payments.When I contacted customer care (which they make extremely hard to do) I explained my problem and the customer care agent referred me to another agent who referred me to another agent until I was tired. I finally told them that their way of doing things was very inconveniencing to people and ended the chat.LO and Behold not more than 5 minutes later, I received an email telling me my account was permanently suspended.This is my advice to anyone who plans on using PayPal: DONT. Sooner or later they will screw you over. Just save yourself some time and use any other service. Most of my friends have had similar issues with some even having their money stuck for 180 days.

Unexplained Account Limitations,"I have been using PayPal for over 10 years. My current account has been active for approximately 4 years and I have been using it as a business account for approximately 2 years. Until several days ago, everything was great and I had not experienced any issues.Recently, however, I received a small, $2.00 donation through a photo-sharing site where I have chosen to make some of my photography available for download. Payment is not expected or required and donations are freely given if individuals who download my photos choose to do so. As far as I can tell, this donation is what caused PayPal to limit my account and flag me as a ""new merchant"". I have tried calling and have been using the message centre in an attempt to resolve this issue, without success.PayPal is now requiring me to send them sensitive information and to answer irrelevant questions about my business (such as where I store my product/inventory). I do not sell physical goods; I am an ESL tutor who offers online English lessons.I no longer have access to my income through PayPal and I am also unable to pay certain expenses for other platforms and services I had connected to PayPal. Needless to say, this unwarranted and unjustified limitation of my account has caused me to lose all trust in PayPal.Attempts at resolving the issue have only resulted in generic cut-and-paste responses from PayPal support. They have not and do not seem willing to investigate why my account has unexpectedly been limited after 4 years. Neither will they give me more detailed information so that I can be sure that this will not happen again in the future.My advice is to be very careful if you choose to use PayPal, especially for your income or business-related activities. Clearly, PayPal has the ability to arbitrarily freeze all access to funds, without explanation or justification.I have also been threatened with further restrictions should I fail to provide the sensitive, personal documentation they are inexplicably demanding.I will be taking my business and finances elsewhere, to a company I can trust.User beware!",1,2023-02-28T17:08:53.000Z,Ashlee W.

I tried to cancel automatic payments to…,"I tried to cancel automatic payments to two companies. I googled how to do that on paypal. I followed their instructions which said1-open the PayPal APP and click on settingsTHERE IS NO SETTINGS LINK ON THE PAYPAL APPIt cost me $136.00 in automatic payments That I did not use. I could not find out how to cancel them on the PayPal app. THERE'S ALSO NO PHONE NUMBER ON THE PAYPAL APP.I tried to discuss this with a supervisor named Tyler, however he kept just saying that it was my responsibility to go to the website not the app and call them. I kept asking him why does it say open the app and click on settings and there's no settings or phone number on the app and he said oh that's old information however this is the first information that came up in the Google search under how to cancel automatic payments on PayPal. I tried to explain to him that I was following the instructions but there's no settings link and he said I'm sorry you see it that way and that's all he kept saying he couldn't give a fig about the fact that the instructions aren't correct and there's no phone number on the app and kept saying I should have went to their website not the app but not that is not what the instructions said. I had to explain to him that other PayPal users are also going to be confused by those instructions under Google search and he seemed very unconcerned and I kept telling him that they should put the phone number on the PayPal app for customer service and he still didn't really seem to care.

HORRIBLE BUYER PROTECTION,"HORRIBLE BUYER PROTECTION! I purchased a psu from a company (365 Power Supply) & it was the wrong item & was not the genuine product from what was advertised. When I filed a dispute w/Paypal they said I had to return the item @buyers expense to get a full refund as per there policy. When I pointed out to Paypal that the sellers own refund policy stipulates on there site that if they send the wrong item, they will give a full refund & cover the extra fee. The Paypal agent I talked w/said that if I sent them & the seller a picture proving that along w/a message asking for a prepaid shipping label, then they would give me a full refund @the sellers expense (even if the seller refused to provide me w/a prepaid shipping label & it wasn't returned).Then, I get an email from Paypal totally contradicting everything I was told saying because I got a refund (which I didn't) & the item wasn't returned (according to the seller), there going to debit me & take it off my account/card.I had went to Canada Post before this & then told them how much the international return shipping costs are if I were to send it back to China (over 90% of what I paid for the item in total). Also, alot of shipping couriers have a policy against shipping out lithium batteries for safety reasons. After, I talked w/the supervisor @Paypal he just parroted the same thing about how there refund policy works, saying they can't force sellers to send a return label & that there under no obligation either to give a full refund unless it's returned @my expense.  No exceptions.I would stay far away from Paypal, because in these types of situations they will 100% side w/scammers, or other companies who try to discourage customers from going through w/refunds by forcing the customer to eat the cost in return shipping for there mistakes in order to get a full refund. Ebay & Amazon are much better.",1,2023-02-28T07:10:24.000Z,Dre

Pay in 3 double charges frustration,"I didn't want to have to write this because I've not usually had an issue with PayPal but recently their pay in 3 scheme has been consistently double charging me. One charge does eventually go back into my account but in the meantime I'm just out of pocket for a number of days. I've contacted their customer service on each occasion and been told varying things that don't add up like the seller ""didn't claim the funds withing 24hrs"" which considering each seller was different and all said they'd received the funds and dispatched the item kinda sounds unrealistic to be charitable or ""they accidentally charged an old card"" which I definitively didn't use during the transaction. This doesn't happen to any of my family or friends so I'm very frustrated that it just keeps happening to me and then I basically just get told that it's just going to keep happening for no real reason. It'll definitely make me consider other similar services in future instead of doing it via paypal. I find it hard to believe that there's just no solution to it when it worked fine before and works for other people.

Lied about seller protection,"The worst Payment and delivery combination company you can imagine. I provided Packlink with a package as per PayPal and Packlink delivery instructions and received tracking details from them. For several days nothing happened, then suddenly the package had been delivered. Yet, the recipient had not received anything so either the delivery driver had not delivered it, or they had stolen it. Upon contacting Packlink to report this they said they would try delivery again, very strange considering they had said it had already been delivered. I waited again for several days for this but was now updated that no one was home in the second attempt so it would be returned to me. Fair enough I thought, but I never received the parcel back despite them again saying it had been delivered. I do not wish to say their drivers are thieves but clearly something is going on for this. The most disappointing thing is that this is the first time I used Packlink after PayPal recommending them as a courier. PayPal have been just as useless and have now charged me an additional dispute fee due to Packlink inability to track and deliver a parcel. PayPals seller protection is non existent and have blamed me for matters out of my hands.Please avoid both companies and use honest companies who don't blame the customer for their incompetence.",1,2023-02-26T11:55:46.000Z,Tim Dale
I received some broken guitar necks and…,"I received some broken guitar necks and the transaction was paid for using PayPal.At first I tried paying with my debit card ( It is registered  on my account) but that didn't work so I had to transfer money to PayPal to pay for the transaction which then meant my card issuer could not protect the transaction if there was an issue.The transaction soon presented problems as the seller had not put my full address despite me sending 2 emails with it written in full confirming my address. I got hold of FedEx and rectified it and I then received the items ( 2 x very rare irreplaceable guitar necks) and both were broken and not as described.The box was nearly paper thin and could be flattened using a hand and it had a massive hole in it and both necks were in pieces and had oxidation on the metal parts so not in new condition as the locking nuts would need replacing.I opened a claim and sent all the pictures of the box the the broken necks and the oxidisation to PayPal.They said I had to return them to the seller even though they are broken?I refused as I dont have a suitable box or the means to return at present.The seller is saying it's not her fault but I am saying it absolutely is if you cant put them in a sturdy box when being sent from the US to the UK and citing her previous feedback which is irrelevant as it's my experience I have an issue with not anyone else's, her lack of apology is just coming across as arrogant and evasive.It's not about the money, I needed those parts and have had no choice but to spend £100 on titebond and clamps etc to try and fix them because they cant be found or purchased again anywhere.So not only have I had a terrible buying experience but I have spent a further £100 and now have to mess around fixing the necks.PayPal have done absolutely nothing, they can see the evidence and I feel I should at least get something back.Of course they aren't available at weekends to talk to on the phone which is ridiculous, I work weekends and I dont get why a 24/7 transaction company does not have 24/7 agents available. I simply dont have any more time to waste explaining myself to another agent and also trying to do that just before I have to get out the door as PayPal are 8.00 am til 6pm or whatever.UPDATE:I have since received an email from PayPal saying they have reviewed the case and it's been resolved.OMG! They are a joke, I closed the case because the only option available was to return the broken guitar necks but due to their extreme rarity I decided to keep them and mend them, I messaged the seller asking for her to do the right thing and give a partial refund for the inconvenience, damage and cost to repair.She is completely ignoring me. BEWARE, if you make a purchase using solely PayPal as they really are incompetent, useless and extremely unprofessional and you won't get any buyer protection unless you send the item back at your own expense which of course in some instances is not possible.I since emailed PayPal and made a complaint and all I got was an auto generated email telling me how ""Seriously!"" they take all complaints. My response was less than calm and I did lose it and tell them to remove their fingers from their backsides and do something but of course its PayPal so they wont.",1,2023-03-08T06:40:04.000Z,Alistair Keene

There is no money in the account only all my personal information that I no longer want onPayPal for security reasons.

Stay away from PayPal , they first lock your money with excuses and then trade and don’t give you back your funds. Who ever had such issues with them need report them to the financial authorities and sue them in the Court to stop their frauds. They need to be closed as platform and their licence struck off for ever otherwise they will follow up robbing people and companies.

PayPal - authority to steal from your account,"We sell made-to-order carports. Customer orders in the knowledge that orders take 3 weeks to make and delivery. Our manufacturer will not make these until they receive payment. Once manufacture commences, there is a minimum 20% of cost penalty for cancellation. Product is in excess of $2000. After payment and one week later a customer decides to cancel the order. Customer knows there will be a penalty so goes to PayPal to inform them goods have not been delivered. The situation is explained to PayPal and within 48 hours they decide to ‘steal’ the payment from our bank account and refund the customer leaving us over $400 loss in payment to our manufacturer. Seems impossible to make any appeal and makes it impossible for businesses like ours to trust this business. PayPal are typical of a  large organization with such a strong monopolistic- type grip on the on-line payment market that they do as they please.  Would strongly advise any seller to stay away from PayPal if at all possible. They have no interest in understanding your business and refuse to negotiate,I’ve had other disputes with PayPal where it is extremely difficult to understand how we could be in the wrong.

But this recent freezing and deactivation of accounts simply because they either don’t like your political opinions, don’t like the items sold, or they just “feel like it” is absolutely ridiculous. I’m done with PayPal and I tell anyone reading to proceed using them with caution. They are tracking every payment, every purchase, and they will send it to the IRS.

In the event of a dispute, PayPal will seek to recover the funds from you by debiting your PayPal balance and, if there are not sufficient funds in your PayPal balance, PayPal reserves the right to collect your debt to PayPal by any other legal means.If you want to refund your buyers, you are able to do that any time as long as the status of the transaction is completed.  To issue a refund, go to the activity page, click the payment you want to refund, and click refund this payment.If you do not have the ability to process a refund, you can reply to this email with the transaction details. We’ll send a refund on your behalf using money from your PayPal balance.Due to the potential risk of chargebacks and other risks of funds reversals, your balance will be held 180 days from the date of the limitation. At that time, any remaining funds will be available for withdrawal.I advise nobody to open new account with them and choose alternative platforms.",1,2023-02-25T02:26:46.000Z,Sdc Gunawardena

PayPal itself is a SCAMMER due to its unethical practices.,"PayPal deserves ZERO star if the rating has this option. It provides ZERO customer service and operates unethically. My PayPal account was created in USA in 2013. I used several times and left it idle for years until 2 weeks ago to sign in. I have noticed that the country name on the primary address under my PayPal account has been changed to Emirates, and my cell# never gets their texts on codes as it has an incorrect country code 971 in front of it... It appears to be PayPal IT error when doing system upgrades. I have reached out to PayPal customer support multiple times and hours of calls to seek for help to fix the error caused by their IT in their system.  HORRENDOUS experience! Their CSRs have no knowledge to handle such situation except for reading me a script---""no access to fix and I have to close the account and open the new one"". Two of CSRs with strong offshore accents in their international department even accused me of picking the wrong country when signing up at the first place. All CSRs I talked to were kicking me around from domestic department to security department to international department, and so on. They ignore the root cause on their end, but simply asked me to close the account and open a new one, then to transfer my money from the old to the new. I was told it is free for such a transfer. After many calls and tons of hours spent, helpless and hopeless, it left me no choice but to create another account to do the transfer. HORRIBLE process! I got charged for receiving the money in the new account, plus the money is on hold and unavailable until Mar. 7th. When the fund is available and to be transferred to my bank, there will be another 3% charge imposed by PayPal. It feels like I am SCAMMED by PayPal. PayPal itself is a SCAMMER due to its unethical practices. Its IT error during upgrades is paid by its customers: 1, can be too costly to fix this non-configurate data on their end. So, it is the easiest way and no cost to PayPal if telling customers to close accounts and open new ones; 2, In so doing, PayPal can make extra money by charging those fees; 3, It will appear an increase in sales, i.e., numbers of new accounts open, on PayPal's financial reports presented to their investors. In addition, it is hard to believe that a company like PayPal 100% replying on internet to operate has no HUMAN chat online or e-mail to reach them. PayPal only has robot assistant who is useless and struggling to provide non-sense answers to the questions asked.I am hoping my incomplete transfer will go smoothly after Mar. 7th. Then, I will close both of my PayPal accounts and no longer use them. I also hope my review will be helpful to other users or potential customers.",1,2023-02-15T22:38:23.000Z,Luna Vika

Customer Service is horrible...,"Booked a hotel on Priceline and paid for it via Paypal.  When I got to the hotel (an hour after booking) they told me they were oversold and had been for 4 hours...they voided my reservation.  After multiple attempts to get a refund from Priceline I reached out to Paypal for help.  Filled out a dispute form.  A few days later Paypal sent me an email saying they had sided with Priceline and paid them out of my bank account.  eMail said I had not provided the requested  additional info.  Thing is, there was no request for additional info.So I called the customer service number.  No one answers the phone but the robot offered to call me back when an agent was free.  5 days later and still have not been called back.  Paypal used to have very good customer service.  Now they are just a schill for the merchants.  I disconnected Paypal from my bank account and connected it to my credit card instead.  I can't trust them with direct access to my bank account anymore.  At least the credit card company will actually do the work to settle a disput.Very disappointed in Paypal.",1,2023-02-15T19:15:47.000Z,Greg Obrien

PAYPAL allows fraudulent Chinese companies to steal…,"PAYPAL allows fraudulent Chinese and other foreign companies to run fraudulent businesses in America. I ordered something that was never delivered. There is no method to contact PayPal. They route you to the business (who isnt a legit business). The company gave me back half of my money which appeased the Paypal algorithm while still keeping the other half of the money. No way to escalate.Every TikTok, Instagram, and FB ad for clothing, shoes, and really any product uses PayPal exclusively to charge for their ""products"". Products you will never receive after ordering. And now PayPal does little to help you get your money back. And they don't kick companies who have consistent complaints off of their platform. At this point, I believe PAYPAL is reaping the benefits of helping these companies ans has no intention of stopping. I am removing my account and deleting the app.",1,2023-02-15T18:23:32.000Z,Jan Mead

Obviously cards do not expire in the US and when I explained that, I was advised to contact my bank for the old numbers as I did not have any old statements up the loft.

Scary incompetence or something else!,"I have a charge on my Paypal account (not insignificant in amount) that is indicated only as *9.  I called Paypal customer service (a number I found online but not on the Paypal online site itself) and after the Paypal recording did everything it could to discourage me from talking to a real person, I was finally connected.  And I can certainly understand the company's reluctance to have anyone talk to a real Paypal person.  The first person had no idea of what this charge meant (i.e., the *9 charge description) and she could find no record of it on Paypal's own internal records.  This person then mistakenly connected me to someone in Paypal's loan department who, understandably (since this did not involve a loan), knew nothing regarding this charge, and he could find no record of it either.  Long story short--I have been charged a significant amount of money that shows up both on my credit card account and on my personal Paypal account but for which Paypal itself apparently has no record or explanation!  And now I am supposed to wait for a call from Paypal.  Yea, like that's going to happen.  I have now removed all credit card information from my Paypal account and will not use this service again.UPDATE:  Someone from Paypal did call me back and he was able to find the charge and explain it to me.

Paypal supports scammers,"In summary:Bought a 'Kindling Splitter' from Facebook from 'Blazecrown' for £24.99. They had the appearance of a UK company and I paid for the item using Paypal, thinking their buyer protection was actually worth something.The item was nothing like the ads and videos suggested and was not fit for purpose. I requested an immediate return/refund and instead was offered £3.00 as a 'good will gesture'. Naturally I refused and asked to return the useless item for a refund. I provided solid proof that the item was nothing like the one described online, and the offered £8.00 this time, which I again refused. I was asked to return the item to China, despite it allegedly being sent from the USA with bogus tracking info. The cost to send it to China with tracking was £18, so I opted to the £7.00 option (45 days to arrive), with proof of posting provided. In the mean time I claimed a refund from Paypal who requested all my evidence and correspondence, which I duly provided to them; they also asked for tracking info for the return, which of course I didn't have. Paypal rejected my claim on those grounds. I also wrote to the Chinese scammers, pointing out that they would have definitely received the return by now and asked for a refund again. They didn't even reply. So the moral of the story is; don't buy junk off Facebook anymore and don't use Paypal for anything ever again; they are useless and are supporting these scam companies to separate people from their hard earned cash.Date posted: 13 Feb 2023",1,2023-02-13T23:17:04.000Z,Mark

Take down paypal,"If there was an option for no stars then I'd of chosen that. Currently compiling a report on user experiences of paypal. So the good thing was to try them myself. Deposited around £40 purchased crypto currency, an option I've been hearing so many complaints about and was tied up in repeated failed attempts to first sell the currency (at vital moments), but also was tied up in this process where you try to withdraw your money, are placed in what was described as a 'risk' queue for 24hrs. Note: at this point I'm trying to withdraw to my linked and verified account. I tried the next day same thing. However, on advise from someone who'd complained to me I tried to transfer my money to someone else's account. Which I did after paying paypal £1.99. Low and behold it goes through. Quite what paypal is trying to 'protect' people from with this protocol I do not know, but it seems their concern fails the moment you do something with more 'risk', but presents a fee. But no more.

"They lie at the open, then completely fail at everything until it benefits them","A few days ago I gave PayPal a negitive review because I called customer service over a week before an issue became an actual problem and they couldn't or wouldn't help me, while letting me think It was okay.In the end I had to go to my bank to fix it. Which leads me to now.First off let me say that the recording telling you they have a high call volume and prompting you to go through their chat system when you call is a blatant lie. The first time I used it it expired before I could make time (15 minutes)I tried again and was left waiting until the chat auto closed.I called again and said no to the text on the prompt. Within 1 minute I was speaking to a rep. I have needed to make 4 additional calls and every time I say no and get a rep within a couple minutes. Sadly the reps are all incompetent. So to the actual problemAfter PayPal couldn't help me I went to my bank about the same issue. I had to report the transaction as a unapproved transaction (which it technically was).PayPal, who didn't really take interest in the issue before suddenly became quite concerned they separated all my payment options from their system. They also called me (which I was 1/2 sure was a scam because it was an robocall) to tell me this.I have to take 4 steps to reconnect my accounts. I have tried two of them twice and gotten no results.I wouldn't care as PayPal is a service I would never use again at this point, but I have PayPal credit which I must pay off. Which I can't pay off until they let me reconnect my accounts.They have made it clear I will be fined and charged interest and the debt will be sent to collections if I don't pay.This is one of the most predatory practices I have ever seen.",1,2023-02-10T17:09:35.000Z,Travis Mandenberg

I ended up not only losing my intial outlay plus paying paypal credit. in total £459.98 plus all the postage. the irony was that I made a claim with paypal against Evri while trying to get my refund from the ebay seller Gamesinspire for non delivery of the parcel and paypal awarded me the case and refunded me the outlay from the courier.",1,2023-02-10T15:01:17.000Z,Mike Lewis

Switching to credit card like everyone else,"For years PayPal worked fine, but its recent screw-up means I'll never use it again. It made a serious mistake when I paid for an online purchase: it tried to withdraw the payment from a bank account I had never given it permission to access. The account number was similar to my main account, so apparently that explains the error. It tried to take from this account twice, emailing me that it was my fault I didn't have enough funds in that account. That one is savings only, where I keep the interest from my checking account, and I never use it for transactions. Because of PayPal's mistake, my bank charged me overdraft fees. When I used the chat feature to demand help, PayPal did not understand the problem and still tried to blame me. Then when they understood, they never took responsibility, never offered an apology, and never tried to increase my satisfaction at all. I will not use them again.

PayPal!! We're DONE!!!,"PayPal!!! Wow, they acted like a weird and creepy pal first of all. I booked an airbnb, used PayPal as the payment method and chose to pay in full - therefore coming straight out of my bank account, I had the funds and wanted to pay there and then - I got my confirmation from airbnb that all was done. Day after, I see no money has come out of my account (I keep an eye on my finances, especially in these days of frugal and careful budgeting and balancing) I went to my PayPal account and contacted them. Was told 'it will come out soon dude, don't worry, got yo covered man' attitude. I don't want that, a creepy arm round my shoulder telling me don't worry when it's MY choice to pay. That was the 29th of Jan. I was told it will come out in a couple of days!! Issue was, they had THREE different methods on file as options to take this money AND told me they were taking it off a bank card number that didn't exist! They've not only strung this out, I have been in touch when it did NOT come out, I've paid into my PayPal account when it failed (I keep an eye out, as I say, and NO reason it failed, I've had to keep that balance for the airbnb on my account, despite usually having the power to have no more than £50 in it, just in case of fraud) so I kept a full £204.65 in it. Due to them stating on the app the THREE different methods, I also had to keep the same amounts on another card, and my credit card as well as in my bank! I couldn't spend money for all this time. Eventuality, they gave me a NEGATIVE BALANCE on my PayPal account on 3rd Feb!!! I then paid into my PayPal account so it was NOT negative, and was cleared!!! I contacted them again and was told again ""duuuuuuude is all OK man, nothing bad gonna happeeennn!"" - my balance was in credit, the airbnb paid in full, several communications to say ""dooooooooodis all fine, relaxxxxxxx""Today..... today I get a text from my bank!! £378.82 taken!!! Bank fees to be paid, online shopping cancelled. I call PayPal, they say yes you owe us nothing and yes you've done nothing wrong but ""dooood, like your money will totally be back in your PayPal account in 5-7 working days so relaxxxxxx""NOT ONLY did they delay, when they then went into my account they TOOK the payment again, plus a balance that WOULD have existed if they'd NOT been able to take that money (I had £30 in my PayPal as well as 3 x the money in the 3 method for full payment - £204.65 x 3 + £30 credit in PayPal) I cannot understand why they think this is 1. OK to start up, 2. Then mess up and 3. Not resolve!! Worst processing I've ever seen!!! Eff you PayPal, you're no pal, you're a messed up company that cannot process anything, nor actually let humans resolve issues nor be suitable for HUMANS to be involved with EVER AGAIN.

Paypal sided with them and i was out more money.  they (paypal) support theft by their vendors and don't give a crap about the security of their paying customers.   for this reason i highly recommended consumers use other ways to make online transactions.   paypal is not consumer safe.",1,2023-02-06T14:16:07.000Z,Ray LaPointe

It appears that the acount is building intrest thus the mis-step by the collections rep of $72 and a correction to $55.74.

I recently bought something didn’t see it was coming from China it came very late & when it showed up was super cheap & not smart to use on my vehicle. Calling PayPal I was informed there is insurance that you get when using PayPal so I have no worries if the company fights taking it back then the insurance kicks in & gives you money back. I ended up having to call 7 times as they never hooked this claim to my account as their computer system some how couldn’t find me so they had me down as a guest. Talking to all these different people I find out the first 5 phone techs must not know much as the next 2 started saying & pushing the claim in a totally opposite direction. No wonder PayPal will be having huge layoffs they send American jobs to outside the country for cheap help & look at it start crumbling.

Much to my amazement, they sided with Zwilling and suggested I ship the item back at my expense even though the item was defective and covered under warranty.

AVOID using PayPal,"It seems there is no point in using PayPal as there is no buyer protection. I sought support when I received an item that wasn’t as described. The response was: We've reviewed the transaction(s) and are refusing your claim(s). This decision was made because if an item is materially similar to the seller's description, we don't consider it to be significantly not as described.It seems that companies can advertise one thing and send out another. How ridiculous! You are probably more protected just using a credit card - I know I will in the future.",1,2023-01-29T12:44:48.000Z,Lisa Pearce
UnGod like of Paypal,"I guess PayPal feels like they are the right hand of God. Making moral decisions on how we can and can't spend our own money.  I've had my account with them for more than five years. Mainly because it is the only way I can receive my income from Prolific. And since Prolific is the bees knees of survey sites I'm forced to keep it. So until they have another way for me to redeem I'll have to deal with the ever changing tools that we get to use for around a month then suddenly it's gone. I'll have to deal with my money being locked down, because whatever Paypal says is the word I'll struggle to swap on my currency's with the completely buggy app the browser tries to ram down our throats. Only to discover you can't do that with the app, must use the browser.I will bite my tongue when my instant transfer has been stop but the help bot tells me I have no restrictions on my account. I then will spend hours trying to figure out what's been done with my money, then finally, just sending it to my husband so he can send the funds right back toy bank.  And never mind how I've been forced into a completely unnecessary business account that makes my dashboard much more complicated to navigate. No, I'll be showing up to both forms of PayPal. Where I'm allowed to ""view"" my money to look at my money.And more on this topic. Can we please clean up the help section.",1,2023-01-29T13:14:52.000Z,Vanessa M Greer

Never have I been so angry and…,"Never have I been so angry and embarrassed. I got a gift from a family member for my birthday. I was given a PayPal prepaid card. Now I have never used this card so it has been sitting about a month and I decided to use it. I activated the card but only limited use because I only wanted to use it as a gift card. They said online purchases or in store only. I go to use the card and declined. Ok I’m not upset it was on a game so maybe it can’t be used there. I physically go to the store for a few things and declined. Now I’m embarrassed and lucky I have alternative payments with me. I come home and try an online purchase decline. Now I’m angry. I call customer service because this isn’t working and I know the funds are there. I was well below the limit amount. The guy tells me to hold so he can check my account, comes back and proceeds to tell me it’s a limited card. DUH I know this. I’m livid at this point because he’s telling me I need to use the automated service to find out the balance because this is a balance issue. No it’s not. He proceeds to transfer me after I said no I want to talk to someone else. Well he hangs up. I call back exact same thing except when I’m on hold I’m transferred to the automated service. Now I need to take a minute to calm down. I call back wait to be answered in the order of received call and someone literally picks up and hangs up. Seriously 72 minutes of trying to figure out a gift card. Let’s not mention the fact they withheld a monthly fee and it was never even used. PayPal can straight go jump off a canyon as far as I’m concerned. I will never recommend or use this company for anything",1,2023-01-28T22:44:59.000Z,Angela Jones

Account Cancelled - No Explanation,"We have had a PayPal account for many years which we used for both business and private use. Recently the account was suspended because apparently we were not meeting their terms of service. The problem is that there is no indication whatsover as to which terms we appear to be breaching so we have no idea what we are supposed to have done wrong or what we need to do to resolve the issue. Could not PayPal at least do their customers the courtesy of explaining the problem?Documents were requested and provided and we then received a message that our account was cancelled due to the unspecified breach. There was a link to their terms of service but having no idea what might be wrong this was useless.To add salt to the wound they then acted like the mafia stating we would receive a message in 180 days explaining how to retrieve the funds in our PayPal account.We believe PayPal has shown itself to be a company with poor communication skills and systems and one that cannot be trusted. If this behaviour does not breach a number of consumer rights, I'd be surprised.",1,2023-01-28T07:19:33.000Z,Craig Mckenzie
Paypal NO PROTECTION  from FRAUD. Watch your account!,"Have been with Paypal for years.

I contacted Paypal immediately to notify them of this and of course it went to dispute - that a Fraud had been committed.  I NEVER would authorize a monthly payment of ANYTHING from my bank account.  Paypal sided with the company.  I called my bank, explained the situation and they immed. retrieved my monies from Paypal. Since them I have been in contact with Paypal continually, shuffled around from person to another with no resolution. The final discussion was for the agent to try to send me to ""collections""!

PayPal violates its policy to protect buyer's rights.,"Hello Everyone:I would like to share with you a story about PayPal as a third party institution under its created policy and advertisements.  They suppose to represent buyer interest and protect buyer’s rights.  Unfortunately PayPal doesn’t do it.  Or maybe it was before and they don’t do it now.The whole story is about -- I have tried to buy a product from, ops – I didn’t check the company, Hainshow.com (scammer). They accepted a payment from me through the PayPal and …silence…I wrote to Hainshow.com and PayPal, there was a silence again.  After a month I received a note from USPS that the product was successfully delivered. I was not lazy and visited my USPS office.  I found that Hainshow used another address and another addressee on the shipment.  Maybe I would stop my investigation, but the prove-photo from USPS delivery guy, there was a small package.  I orders a product and it would be about 5-6 pounds, definitely not small package.I wrote another message to PayPal with this accident that Hainshow collected several buyers and sent all of them the same tracking number.  One buyer got the order; others got nothing because USPS shows that the order was delivered.  Again, I visited my USPS office. The USPS delivery guy showed me the picture of the package with a different name, different address but the same tracking number.  I made copies and sent to PayPal.  Wow, PayPal didn’t want to do anything, or someone didn’t want to do a real investigation.  They just closed the case.If you ask me what I did – I broke the relations with PayPal and wrote them, that they hadn’t followed their promises, they didn’t protect buyer’s rights and they didn’t spent time for the investigation.My concern they are not qualified for presenting buyer’s rights on the web.  Maybe you are luckier, but I don’t.  I can see there are more complaints, so, I am assuming it is a SYSTEM to lie to their customers.=Andre Morua",1,2023-01-27T01:40:43.000Z,Andre Morua

If they mess up, if a vender or seller messes up, and PP has to levitate beyond the couple of canned options they have decided are the only possibilities of problems you might be having, expect mediocre to terrible or non-existent service.I tried to respond to PP's shaky decision on a dispute today.  There's no way.  PP's number 1 goal is not to provide good service; rather it is to make sure they don't actually deal with you.  You are directed to handle everything online.  Per the usual, they want you to ""chat"" with a robot, who has been programmed by a moron to provide a simple answer to the only four basic questions PP wants you to have (true of all their canned ""help"").  If you have another issue, you're directed to head back over to Help.  There's a ""Call us"" option.  I did, and this morning I waited 2 hours and 15 minutes, listening to their canned spiel (much of which is about going online to solve your own problems...snort) about 90 times before I hung up.  Their number 1 goal was achieved there.  The chat-bot said I could choose ""Email us"", except there is no option there for that.  The other option is go back to the Resolution Center.  The only way to communicate with them is via the case #, which they have closed without hearing all of your part of things.  So if you would like to add that info, there is noooo way to do it.  No phone, no chat, no email...just PP's BS of pretending they offer customer support.  I'm now on the hunt for a better way to pay online etc.",1,2023-01-23T22:10:53.000Z,mlee
NO longer able to speak with a PERSON to help resolve issues.,"I have been using PAYPAL as my payment platform for multiple businesses for some years. I recently had class and all students payment were release except one. Contacted PAYPAL, now you must follow a link (Text/chat). YOu can no longer speak with. The agent in the chat only copy and past texts from the Help Center. Solution given: I need to confirm my ""new account"" that is why funds are being held. I have used the same account, nothing has changed. Additionally, my other student's funds were transferred for the same class, to the same bank account. As a small business our funds are our livelihood and the fact that I can not speak to a person has prompted me to change payment platform. The payment transaction was completed on January 14, 2023, PAYPAL states they will release the fund February 13, 2023. Totally unacceptable. I have three different for transition from PAYPAL. One of my businesses had been using PAYPAL platform since 2016.",1,2023-01-23T20:57:43.000Z,Vee McNeal

I asked why and they said a flag was placed on my account to a earlier dispute which I won. I appealed alongside a police report to which they also shut down. They said do a chargeback through bank but the cleaver sods took my payment via a direct debit leaving me with no solution. Out of pocket with a large amount. If you think paying via PayPal your safe, think again, your better of doing a bank transfer as at least you are protected under section 75 in the UK.

Paypal lost it's way for the following reasons:,"Paypal lost it's way for the following reasons: 1-They forget that the customer is the engine of the economy, not the businesses 2-They take little if any to consider a legit consumer case against a business 3-Paypal has no intentions to sort out issues, it just want to cash the money and make commission. 4-After 10 years doing business with Paypal they couldn't help with small fraud case, with an impeccable account, they didn't stand by me, they sided with the business for $47 5- I am writing this review not because I am upset, I just want people to know how bad is Paypal administration reputation is around the world",1,2023-01-23T09:40:44.000Z,Bernard El Dib

There are also other really annoying things like if you make a business account with your email, you can't make a personal account with that email too.

If your account is hacked you are completely on your own,"I've been with Paypal for nearly 4 years with absolutely no issues up to this point.  I've maily used my account to pay for online purchases with 0 problems until Saturday 14 January when late in the evening my account was hacked and an unauthorised purchase from Hong Kong was made totling upto £587.99.  Literally a minute after the fraudulent transaction had taken place, the fraudsters closed my account which should have triggered 2 factor authentication but it didn't.  Naturally, all my links to Ebay and other companies were broken so I received a few Paypal official legit emails confirming this.  As my account was closed, I have no way of filing a complaint/dispute and after recreating my account on the 15th to see what would happen, none of my transactions are linked to Paypal its a good thing I'm in the habbit of filing all my transactions through Paypal. I tried phoning Paypal but keep on going round and around on an automated system loop so have given up.  I contacted my bank who instantly locked my account, canceled my card and are claiming the funds back from Paypal/ADSR Limited in Hong Kong.  Others reading this review please be aware I'm very security concious so have very complex passwords using binary numbers, random words and characters all over 15 characters in length so I don't understand why 2 factor authentication wasn't triggered in this situation as even sometimes small Deliveroo payments have triggered it on my devices so please please please be very careful if using Paypal.  I'm just releived my bank were sympathetic and could see on my account this was a random fraudulent transaction as they asked me if I'd ever heard of ADSR Limited, where they were based and what business they were involved in.  I'm just glad in my case the bank probably has Paypal contacts higher up the chain of command so can bang heads together but after this, I'm never ever using Paypal and will recommend others not to do the same unless concrete steps are taken especially in cases like mine.  I should make it clear I've scanned all of my devices from malware and everything is fully in the clear.  None of my router logs show any hack from my end so its either been hacked at Paypals end or I've been randomly targeted but I'm glad in my case I'll get a new card and the funds will be back in my account shortly so everyone please beware and take care.  I should also mention yes I have emailed the Paypal phishing team with only an automated reply and I did send them the flurry of official Paypal emails I received late on the 14th.",1,2023-01-18T10:14:04.000Z,Anas Patel
Terrible!!! Do not use!!!!!! Do not trust!!!!,"Terrible, terrible, terrible!!!I bought a guitar on reverb.com using paypal and got scammed by the seller. He pretended to be a guy from new zealand and sold me a pretty expensive guitar, but it never arrived. Turns out the guy was chinese and he put a tracking number of something from Shein. Ok, so I turned to reverb.com who told me i need to open a dispute with paypal. So I did. PAYPAL TOOK THE SIDE OF THE SCAMMER!!!! They closed my case 3 times claiming that i closed it!! They took forever to close it a fourth time saying that i bought the guitar for “resale” so i am not eligible for a refund. What??? I never received anything in the mail!! I had tons of proof but they wouldn’t listen. It took forever for me to finally turn to my credit card company who gave me a refund, but only under the term that paypal will not prove to them that i have received the instrument. So far the money has still not been charged again so i guess paypal has no proof to present. They became a joke company, their buyer protection is A COMPLETE FALLACY, THERE IS NO BUYER PROTECTION !!! I will never use their service again!!! Surely not for anything serious that costs thousands of dollars.",1,2023-01-18T03:24:00.000Z,B.M.

They don’t seem that bothered and it certainly doesn’t protect you as a purchaser.Be very careful everyone purchasing using PayPal as you may lose the item/s you have purchase to an old address that’s not even on your account nor showed on the order when paying. It only showed in an email confirming the purchase by PayPal. This is really poor.",1,2023-01-17T12:23:05.000Z,Matt

Despite haveing a tracking slip confirming receipt by the retailer, we still, nearly 3 months later, have not been reimbursed the £125 cost.Following numerous messages and phone calls to various PayPal Agents around the world, we are now being advised by them that their terms and conditions do not cover items returned to a Seller which are not faulty.Those ladies that do a lot of online fashion shopping, whereby items do not suit or are slightly the wrong size, BEWARE !!! PayPal will not authorise a refund if the Seller does not refund your money.For an International finance Company the size of PayPal, their customer service is just appalling, let alone their customer protection policies.My strong advice is stay away from PayPal and stay with your own bank.

PayPal -Bad As The Scammers,"I ordered Jordan Sneakers from a website that lists a home address in Georgia - Not true.  After weeks of attempting to communicate with these people and unable to reach anyone, I contacted PayPal - who told me that my money was refundable under their buyer protection.  They also said that the seller had to have time to respond.  A few days later the seller sends  PayPal a tracking number from China!  PayPal sends me this same tracking number.   Now I know I've been had - but PayPal still told me that I would get my money back after the process played out.  PayPal asked me for photos and a description of my issue - I sent the photos and a very detailed description including these Jordan sneakers are fake, they are the wrong color and I spent $175.00 with a company that is advertised as being US based in Georgia.  No one in their right mind would spend this kind of money for a shipment coming from China.  This all started on December 9, 2022 - I knew PayPay was jerking me around because they kept moving the dates back for a resolution.  Today 1/16/2023 I awaken to an email stating the case has been closed in the sellers favor because I failed to provide the required tracking number and the tracking number provided was incorrect. Remember, PayPay provided me with the tracking number themselves as the Chinese people wouldn't respond to any of my emails.  Furthermore, PayPal never asked me for any tracking information, they asked for photos and what my issue was.I've been scammed twice - PayPal is absolutely full of crap!",1,2023-01-16T15:58:04.000Z,Mary H.

They then tried to tell me that they were not in control of their heavily marked up currency rates and they were set by the government - do they really think their customers are that stupid! I then said I would get the seller to refund me and just repurchase, PayPal warned me that I might lose money money if the rate moved against me. I said fine but confirmed that I could also make money if the rate moved in my favour, but apparently not!!!

PayPal took my money from Revolut due…,"PayPal took my money from Revolut due to some glitch and now neither of the companies will help. It cost me 30pounds in currency exchange and service fees. I'd say the blame is 50-50 Revolut and PayPal, but neither will own up and just give me back my money.Details are very convoluted, but in summary I was paying an invoice with a PayPal link the payee provided, but I selected I wanted to pay with a card, not with a PayPal account, as I don't use it. Even though I typed in my card details and the transaction is shown on my Revolut and not on my PayPal account, somehow the companies decided to charge me via PayPal in a random currency (the invoice was in pounds and my Revolut account is in pounds, but they charged me in dollars via PayPal, conversing it twice and adding service fees). I asked Revolut repeatedly how it's possible and to provide me with a proof I authorised this, but they admit they are unable to provide me with this. PayPal on their part sent me two reciepts, one showing I paid via the PayPal account and another one showing that I paid with a Revolut card. The transaction in not visible on my PayPal account so I cannot dispute it. Last but not least, my Revolut card is linked to my PayPal account, but due to glitches with PayPal it has incorrect address. This was why I stoppped using PayPal, I could not force it to update the address on the card to the correct one. Normally if the address on the card is incorrect, the transaction should not be authorised. In summary, where is my 30 pounds and since when do you charge people from a random account and in a random currency without a warning?",1,2023-01-15T18:07:59.000Z,Dorota Peszkowska
Paypal and Unreliable Credit Reports,"I frequently use Paypal as an extra protection against scammers so that my bank details are not given out to companies I do not know.

Presumably they were relying on a very outdated credit report. Considering I am honest and always pay what I owe I am really annoyed about this.",2,2023-01-15T09:38:45.000Z,Henry James Kemp

Who the hell hold somebody else money? They even cannot give the reason why they hold my money. Also told me that they will take 7 days to release my account to transfer.

I spent three days trying to sort this out; they finally told me I could contact them on Facebook (absurd), which I did. They were falsely sympathetic about my plight, but told me to ring a Help number in Australia.

I tried finding out whether I could contact a human support person at PayPal to clarify this, but there was no easy way to do that either.

PayPal should be shut down,"PayPal should be shut down by the Financial Ombudsman. They bully their representatives on the phone to deny buyer protection. You can actually hear the supervisors yelling. They also will give buyers advice to claim with their bank instead making their services completely redundant. Why use a company that is supposed to protect your purchases  if they don't actually do so.The big new change in PayPal policy is if a seller pays return postage and the item goes missing back to them or they refuse delivery, even if tracking shows it has been collected from you, you have a valid collection slip... in short you have done everything right...the scammer who takes your money and then again claims the same sum from the courier they booked gets to walk away with it double the money....and PayPal is happy to support this scam as they did with case PP-R-DVK-464125819.What about Paypal's complaints procedure you ask? Cases no longer display an appeal button. When you submit their formal complaint form you just don't hear back or get an acknowledgement, that is assuming it goes through in the first place as an error message will pop up several times as you try to submit. If you complain via their messaging system, all you will get is a copy/pasted response saying something about Cryptocurrency even if completely irrelevant. In short they just want to stop you escalating to the Financial Ombudsman. But remember if they don't issue a final response within 8 working weeks you can still report them.",1,2023-01-09T11:24:10.000Z,Sisi Doneva

When questioned about this the CS said I had no promotional balances in my account. I sent screenshots of over a dozen purchases over $99 that need to be paid off May 12th, June 12, and July 12th. Apparently if you have a balance outside of those purchases any payment gets applied to those first and the only way to pay off the promotional balance is to pay off the entire account by the earliest promotional balance due date.

Paypal screwed me over!,"I always trusted paypal. I then started a business in brazil, where I had a dishonest client who paid for a tourist service that I provide. After using our services, he simply made a claim that he did not use the service, and requested a refund from his credit card company. After sending proof, photocopies of tickets that the customer signed, and other evidence proving that the customer used the service, Paypal sided with the credit company and I had to refund everything plus dispute fees. They did not back up their claim, and showed no reasoning why they decide the dispute in favor of the client trying to scam me and their credit card company. They decided in favor of an obvious scam artist over a legitimate business owner with no reason to lie. Now Paypal claims I owe them money, since I already withdrew the amount paid. Paypal does not support the businesses that use them!!! I would rather have bad credit than give them the satisfaction of returning the funds they claim I owe. Paypal, go eff yourselves. Your company is short lived, and I’ll be playing a violin on deck while your ship is sinking.

Absolute sham of a company.,Been a PayPal customer for almost 20 years but not anymore. Recently bought a bag on eBay which the seller has already sold to someone else but not closed the listing. Seller cancelled the transaction but didn’t refund me so I had to file a dispute with PayPal. They don’t give a toss. Sent them screenshots to prove the seller had cancelled the transaction and they acknowledge seeing these screenshots and that they can see the seller hasn’t refunded but insist I have to wait several weeks whilst the seller hangs onto my money and refuses to acknowledge the dispute. PayPal won’t confirm that I’ll be refunded despite the information that I have and if you complain they just send you the same automated response. Been going back and forth all day and getting nowhere. Will lodge a complaint with the ombudsman and claim my money back via a chargeback with my credit card as PayPal have left me no alternative. I’m certainly not losing £180 due to the seller being a thief and PayPal thinking that’s ok. Will be closing my PayPal account as soon as possible and never touch them again.

Brave New Paypal,"As the largest Company, PayPal had great times and worse times. It is not similar to Skrill and others, less expansive, which started as a helpful start-up. Then grew up being sold to people who act like they are living in their Universe. And then they stopped caring for their Customers. You forget such Companies and move to alternatives.     You can't act like that with Paypal. You can not bypass them if you are not influential enough. So with Paypal, I remember worse times and tried to use alternatives, then they called me themselves and offered the best possible conditions. I start using them again. These times Pay Pal stepped in a low crest of a wave. It happens, I think because they try to create Orwell's 1984 for their users. I don't know if they are under some pressure or if it's their idea - but with that pressure and limitations, I won't be surprised that more and more people will become libertarians, even those, like me, who didn't care ""about the glass"" ever before.   Currently, I can not pay with my money from my bank account, as they have a glitch not allowing me to do that. ""For security reasons,"" I can spend my 25K credit card without any problem and withdraw any money FROM the Paypal account. But have a problem returning this money to Paypal or sending it back TO Paypal. The ideal situation is if I was a fraudster, but I care about my credit score. :-)   After 7+ hours on the phone with support and two months of regular calls, some supervisors told me that because I use VPN, I am blocked. And this is written in their privacy policy. I trusted and just gave up, paying over the phone with Synchrony bank. PayPal was working perfectly otherwise. But recently, I decided to open a business account, which was blocked right after I created it.    This situation encouraged me to read their User Agreement: ""Section 9.1 Title. 9.1 Restricted Activities. In connection with your use of our website, your Account, the PayPal Services, or in the course of your interactions with PayPal, other Users, or third parties, you will not: q...use an anonymizing proxy."" VPN is not proxy or anonymizing proxy, but they probably have no problem to fix it. To my question why this rule exists, Paypal employee informed that they need to control our location, the device and all data related to us. No matter if we have 2FA and face ID protection, they don't care it is you or not. They care if they control where you move and what you are doing. If we all will follow this policy, I bet where we will end.",2,2023-01-06T22:52:06.000Z,Viktoryia

Yet PayPal not Meta Pay seems to care at all. So I just gave away $130. These companies are just as much thieves as the thief himself. I will NEVER recommend PayPal or Meta Pay ever again. In fact, I will go out of my way to let anyone who’s thinking of using their services under the assumption tht they are protected, to stay way away from using them.

Verification issue,"I have used PP for a number of years and have been very happy with their service (unlike other users on Trustpilot).

Didn’t work. When I pressed on the camera icon it kicked me right out of the app. So, to answer oncoming questions, yes I uninstalled the app, then of course downloaded it again…didn’t work. Logged out and back in…didn’t work. I tried shutting off my phone then turning it back on…didn’t work. Logically Ingo said that the issue is with the app, and to contact PayPal, which I did. We again went through all of the above stuff to humor them, and it didn’t work. I asked for a supervisor, and was chuckled at and basically told me I’d just get transferred back to her department. I ask for technical support…oh, we don’t have a tech support department. Only customer service. No help AT ALL.So, then begins the transfer shuffle. I was transferred back and forth for over 3 HOURS!! The check cashing company I know did everything they could, but, this is a PayPal app issue. Asked for a supervisor again and got “Laura” #1670162. She literally kept repeating to call Ingo. I asked if we can do a conference call with Ingo to get this straightened out, and of course they said no.Keep in mind I cannot cash this check anywhere because  in order to deposit the check, you have to right VOID across the front of the check.

I emailed the seller, who provided a Canad Post return label, and the items were returned after only 5 days, with verification of a signature by the seller.  Now the seller is refusing to refund my money after they got their product back, and PayPal seems quite ok with that.I’m deleting my PayPal account and calling VISA to re-issue any cards that were associated with my Paypal account as I CANNOT TRUST PayPal to be an Honest Broker.I suggest you DELETE your PayPal account and put that WORTHLESS company out of business!",1,2023-01-04T00:49:21.000Z,Harel Davidson

"Horrible, frustrating and lacking customer care",I can no longer login to my account as I do not have a mobile phone.

I strongly urge you NEVER to use this service.,"One of my clients wanted to set up a recurring payment. Since we had success with PayPal for onetime payments I thought I'd try to use them for that service. Although I have many years of using PayPal standard, recurring payment are only available  through PayPal business. It was their reccomendation to set up a new account instead of converting my long-established one as a business account. I have regretted the decision to use PayPal business every day since making it. Not only did they charge me for this service, they have held my money for 21 days, even though I have a very good relationship with all my clients. They, of course, immediate took out their fee, which in my opinion is a terrible value. Plus, PayPal ""customer service"" is the worst I have ever experienced. They do not have anyone available to talk on the phone and their chat takes them several hours to respond. When the do respond via chat, the information is less than useless. I strongly urge you NEVER to use this service.",1,2023-01-03T17:09:55.000Z,Philip Quintas
I’m leaving PayPal,I’m leaving PayPal.  At first Ifound them convenient but it’s become a nightmare receiving credits so after I receive a credit on my Amex I am closing my account.  I am quite frustrated as well as I believe they are trying to lure you into credit and debit cards.  I’m not exactly how I received two hard credit checks but they were issuing me two cards for 1k and 5 k.  And then they incidentally provided me a debit card which I don’t trust or need.  I broke my wrist but I have Chase cards with 5 x the limit and suddenly my credit score dropped from excellent to good. I never can speak to a human being and when I have regarding an issue with Archives they are entirely rude.  I would discourage anyone from using them which I hate as initially they did quite a good job managing disputes etc.  Perhaps with Christmas they are inundated but certainly they should not make a hard credit check when they say it’s a soft one.  I am closing the cards as I don’t need them.  I’m trying to see if I can contact the credit bureaus less they know I did not need the cards.,2,2023-01-03T08:14:06.000Z,Susan Gibaux

PayPal made my account balance negative, clearly an error on their part refunding the victims of the scammer, and then THEY, THEMSELVES, SENT ME DEBT COLLECTION LETTERS!!!!What kind of company is this? Getting sent a debt collection notice can negatively affect your credit. I didn't ask for any of this, and PayPal is responsible for all of this happening. Yet, when I call and speak to a supervisor, they don't have the power to 0 out the account.They'll be hearing from my attorney tomorrow :)Everyone, do yourselves a favor and do everything in your power not to use PayPal for any online transaction.

It's almost as if they know you have no other alternatives so they will mess you about and never provide any actual help. The customer service that their clerks provide is equivalent if not worse than what a bot could do.Every single time I had to speak with them they were unhelpful, seemed to have no knowledge about their own systems, shifted the blame to everyone but themselves, gave me scripted and completely USELESS responses (just thinking about it raises my blood pressure).I live for the day when the negligence that Paypal puts in will backfire and a newer, better company will take their throne.The ONLY reason I give them a 2* review is because whilst their service is crap, and their website is buggy, they are a very useful service to have.Do better Paypal.",2,2022-12-30T16:06:04.000Z,Mantas Navickas

"I got scammed, and PayPal helped the scammer.","I got scammed, unfortunately. I authorized a transaction to pay a site $59, but PayPal allowed the seller to take $80 from my account. When I questioned it and filed a dispute, PayPal closed the dispute after an hour of “investigating” and said they had documents that I did authorize this. I asked them numerous times for those documents, which they claim in their emails that I can request at any time. They never sent them, and nobody responds. PayPal helps scammers and probably is a scam itself. Avoid at all cost.",1,2022-12-24T16:39:49.000Z,Maiv Lauj
BUSINESS LEADER : FLEE PAYPAL AT ALL COST,"For the memo, we decided to move from Stripe to Paypal in early November. Well, that was a very bad decision. While Stripe put us at absolute risk, Paypal made us discover a new level of hell.Here is below an email addressed to PayPal:It's now 24/12/2022 and PayPal is still holding 50 000 euros from our own funds while we received official communication from PayPal on 16/12/2022 that the account has been verified and all the funds on hold are set available. As of today, we are still unable to transfer the fund which still appears on hold. We have been calling customer service almost every 48 hours since early November and received so much misinformation. Everything is documented and while PayPal is putting our business at the highest level of risk in our history, we are taking legal action. The situation is utterly alarming, distressing, and disappointing beyond imagination. We are going to make sure no business leader has to go through the hell we went through for the last 8 weeks.",1,2022-12-24T16:11:16.000Z,TC

After the 180 days I receive an email saying i can now log on and withdraw the money. I have ever since moved to another country and the number i used to register has been disconnected long ago. Now when I try to log on it is forcing me to reset password but I dont have access to the number anymore. There is also absolutely no way to contact PayPal without logging in!! WhatTtheF??

Legal action required to retrieve funds from PayPal,"As an attorney, I strongly advise against using PayPal for any financial transactions. In my experience, PayPal has consistently demonstrated a lack of reliability and transparency when it comes to holding and releasing funds.In particular, I have encountered numerous instances where PayPal has promised to release funds to my clients, only to renege on that promise without any valid justification. In some cases, my clients have had to retain legal representation and engage in costly legal proceedings in order to retrieve their funds.Overall, PayPal's frequent failures to follow through on their commitments and their lack of accountability make them a highly unreliable financial service provider. I strongly recommend seeking alternative options for online payments and financial transactions.",1,2022-12-24T03:34:11.000Z,Jay

Worst customer service ever,"Stay away from this company. It's horrible to deal with. Their customer service is very hard to reach - either you have to deal with a bot in the chat, or they are not ""available"" at the moment, or simply they won't reply. I got a request for money from a scammer, and sent the request back. Probably not the smart thing to do, right, but guess what happened? PayPal banned my account and kept the scammer's one up. Zero protection against fraud, that same fraud they say they fight to protect customers. Zero. They're withholding my funds right now - they can do up to 180 days, and they're ignoring my messages. Literally ignoring my messages, like a teenager blocking you on WhatsApp. And don't even get me started about their fees... all they have is a monopoly, and a lot of people who have no other means to make their payments. I really hope there's a viable alternative soon, and that they go out of business, rather sooner than later. The worst company ever by far.

Paypal is a rip off,"Paypal was great for almost 8 yrs. I used them and never noticed an issue. In the past month. I was billed incorrectly on two separate occasions. The first time they ruled in my favor and gave back my money but the second time. Even with all my evidence submitted..I was denied my claim. I'm poor af. I can't afford to be billed twice on one purchase. Last Nov 27th I ordered a a few items during the black Friday sales. First I bought a $1103 laptop for my son's xmas present and then I ordered clothes for my dog ND lastly with $148 left in my account I ordered my son some clothes that were on SALE from the adidas site..my total purchase was $76.12 and my savings on that purchase was $72.50 Paypal charged me the $76.12 and $72.50 and that put me behind $3 for my earlier laptop purchase. Freaking out I raced to my bank to add more money to my account  before best buy tried to take the money upon shipping it and I noticed once I got to the bank that paypal did a ""payment correction"" for $3!! At this point I'm thinking this doesn't look like a computer error. So buyers beware do not use paypal. They've become scammy. I'm gonna close my account and start using prepaid credit cards again. The extra $10 I pay for the fees will be worth the piece of mind I get from not having to worry about being billed incorrectly.",1,2022-12-21T19:54:47.000Z,Sonya
They have horrible customer service and…,They have horrible customer service and they do illegal things all the time. It's ridiculous how many times I've been shocked by things they have done.

Last night I decided to give them one more chance and use their payment plan I had it all set up it showed the 4 payment there on my screen and PayPal ended up taking the fill amount from my bank which I didn't authorize. It's not like they do a credit check or anything so I wasn't declined. My credit would have been good enough anyway even if they did. When I contacted them they just said oops our bad but we can't fix it you have to cancel the transaction and do it again. So I'd have to have that money held until a return could be processed and then make another purchase? Completely inconvenient let alone all the time and trouble I'd have to go through.

In their claim, they haven't uploaded any evidence except one message that said ""YouTube channel not received, I want my money back"". I provided over 30 pictures of evidence that were numerically labeled so that they could be easily reviewed, and I wrote a ton of text for each labeled picture explaining how the channel transfer unfolded, as well as multiple messages in which the buyer confirmed that everything was received and that they were very satisfied. I received an email in less than 6 hours in which they informed me that they had decided in favor of the buyer.

If you run a business : beware,"I’m sure this review won’t effect this company in the slightest, because they don’t have an actual platform to leave reviews per their website or app but definitely beware if you’re a seller and use PayPal for business transactions. I’m a photographer that has used PayPal for transactions since 2017. I have not had a SINGLE “case” against me untill late 2022. I think that’s important to mention that I’ve had a successful business and have never had an issue reported and that shows on my PayPal profile. So I’m a “protected buyer”. I had a previous client dispute a retainer and travel fee even though I was owed both legally per my contract. PayPal “reviewed my case” and refunded them without even contacting me and closed my case so there’s nothing I can do. I’m livid. After doing some research they ALWAYS choose the buyers side. I just wouldn’t do business through them if you- yourself run a business. I haven’t used PayPal since this issue and won’t be returning and before this incident I’d use them weekly so you’d think they’d connect the dots easily. ✨Your fees were ridiculous anyways ✨",2,2022-12-18T01:53:59.000Z,Savannah Sheets

"Lying, Orwellian Garbage","I had a paypal account for ~15 years.  I do NOT have a cell phone and will NEVER have one.  Until this year I have had no trouble accessing my account without one.  Suddenly paypal decided to put up a screen at log in, after entering my password, requiring the providing of a cell phone number—which I don’t have—to access my own damn account. After four different phone calls to customer service, beginning last week, they proceed to put me through a runaround.  First it was wait 24 hours for us to reset your account, then log in, and you’ll be able to bypass the cell phone requirement.  Then, when that didn’t work, it was wait 48 hours for the same, again to no avail.  And the entire time they’re trying to get me to reset my password, which was never the problem.  It was the screen requiring the providing of a cell phone number that wasn’t there before that was the problem, which they, of course, know all too well.  They’ll give you the token “we’re sorry, sir” corporate, pre-recorded, cookie cutter speech then attempt to gaslight you.  They know full and well they have no intentions of allowing you access to your own account, one that was established WITHOUT a cell phone, unless you now provide them with a cell phone number, and they know that they have no legal right to deny you access to your own account.  They use the pretext of “additional safety,” which was never requested by me, is nothing but a transparent excuse to access additional private information from their users and thereby exercise further control over them, and is a moot point when the so-called tool for employment of this “safety,” a cell phone, doesn’t even exist.

This organization is criminal putting…,"This organization is criminal putting every agreedment, they even put imaginary agreedments because they even steal your money, 3 years ago i got scammed with $500 usd and they never penalized the scammer and they charge my account to -$500 in balance, they put negative the balance wich when i call a supervisor he fixed the balance and told me that i dont need to pay anything, past week i sold a digital good and paypal stole the money directly, call 4 times and they said i need to pay the amount of -$350 wich is not true because my balance was fixed and the supervisor itself told me i dont need to pay. I tried the 4 times to contact a manager or supervisor and they wont transfer because they say so, i threat them to sue them and they dont care and hang up you. I lost my digital good because i sold it to the customer without recieving any money backYou cant even close your account because i have a ""debt"" wich is imaginary and cant do anything, its been more than 8 days without getting the money backI been using paypal since 2017 and i never had this damn problem. Is not the first time they steal more than $600 usd to me i dont recommend using this platform, they are bunch of criminals, sadly the banks entities  wont do anything because they benefit from it",1,2022-12-16T19:37:17.000Z,Asura Forte
Less safe and more unfriendly than a normal bank,"Ordered something, didn't receive the item, filed a ""claim."" The seller didn't respond. PayPal then sent me an email telling me that my ""claim"" will be automatically closed if I don't ""take action."" As a result of that email I reached out to the seller via the App as the email said I can get in touch with the seller or ""escalate""; however, PayPal closed the case a few days later because I didn't ""escalate"" (whatever that means: I didn't see any way to ""escalate"" in their clunky and unorganized App). This has the implication that I will not be able to dispute this payment via PayPal ever again. Instead, PayPal told me, I will have to go via German authorities. They weren't very friendly, helpful or accommodating.So here is the deal:With an ordinary bank the procedure in a case like this is simpler, less confusing, and more efficient. If you want to use a means of payment there are better companies and there is no need for this service altogether. PayPal makes your life rather complicated than simple, is less safe than normal methods of payment, and more anonymous and unfriendly than my bank.",1,2022-12-16T19:10:10.000Z,Mike

Absolutely disgusting,Absolutely disgusting. This is theft. I set up a PayPal in 3 over the weekend. Come Monday PayPal took the first direct debit instalment. Therefore the next wasn’t due until January. However I accidentally paid a duplicate on-top of the £166 PayPal had already taken. I called them the next day and explained the above and requested a refund due to needing the cash for other bills throughout the month. I was told that I was a priority and will be receiving  the refund no later than the 15th. I called yesterday as I made it clear I needed the refund before the end of the week and was then told you‘ll receive it Friday. I have now checked my bank and also my PayPal and I have NOT received my £166 back! I have a child to care for and it’s a week before Christmas. You have broke your credit and loan agreement by keeping and accepting Jan’s payment when I told you that transaction was a mistake and needed the cash for other outgoings. Not to mention your not due any other payment until January. I will now be contacting my bank for further action.,1,2022-12-16T06:59:05.000Z,Kate

Omg I just closed my Paypal account,"Omg I just closed my Paypal account. On Dec. 11 I paid for a service with Paypal. Like always Paypal immediately sent me an email confirming my payment with the amount, bank account/ card used and to whom it was going. All of it was correct. However days later Dec. 13 I received another email from Paypal saying that the bank refused to make the payment and so they used my back up bank and card. THEY somehow switched things around AND they then told me in the email that they DELETED my other bank account and card!!!! I said What the !!!  That bank account ( the one they deleted) and card is still active I just don't use it much. I double checked everything and  yes I used the correct bank account and card when I made the payment. EVERYTHING was correct And Paypal confirmed this in the original payment conformation email. So then how did everything get all screwed up? How THEY decided to change the payment method and switch to my other account and then LIE to me and say that I used the wrong bank account and card (when I still have their original email proving otherwise) and how they proceeded to tell me that the bank refused to pay it. I checked the other account and there were NO transactions. PERIOD. They LIED and they DELETED my other bank account and card for no reason.

Attempted to scam me!!,"PayPal has been trying to scam me requesting a payment I submitted!!! BE AWARE!!!I have been using PayPal for years, and I have NEVER had problems with my account. On the contrary, I've always found it to be extremely handy.But from October to now, I have been living in a CONSTANT NIGHTMARE. PayPal has been harassing me, threatening me, the employees I spoke to, said they would help resolve the situation and only made it worse. I have a serious health problem and it has now been aggravated because of the way I have been treated by PayPal!!I started my pay in 3 in August 2022 and I have been making all regular payments. I submitted the all 3 payments without issues.However, after I submitted my last instalments on the 30/10, I received an email stating that my payment for September FAILED and my account was in arrears.I went to my PayPal account and there was nothing to suggest that my payment had failed. Actually, it said that the payment was RECEIVED (the 24/09) even before my due date on the 30/10, as I personally made the payment.Since the day - after having submitted the last payment on the 30/10, I then started to be harassed by PayPal. I have been receiving calls, during my working hours - they call me and tell me that I need to provide my details to verify my account; I have been threatened that if I don't process a ""payment immediately, we will make it harder for me to get a future credit""; they have demanded that I submit a payment immediately, as I have not paid.On the 25/11 I decided to call my bank and find out what was going on. I called my bank and explained to them what had happened. My bank looked through my account and stated the ""money has DEFINEETLY been REVEIVED by PayPal. It has gone through, there is no record of them sending the money back"". As I expected.I then called PayPal, and on that day, I spoke to more than 5 employees regarding this issue.They were transferring me to one person to the other, giving me false information:1. One person told me that the money was not received;2. another person told me that the payment was not proceed because £0.01 was missing;3. Another person told me that the money was refunded;4. Another told me that I requested the money back because I did not receive the item;5. Another told me that my bank opened a dispute and that it has been favourable to me.6. I was also asked ""how many more credits I am struggling to pay"". When I asked the gentleman what he meant by that, he said that I sound like someone who does not fulfils their payment, on time.I felt so embarrassed, ashamed and discriminated by what he said. I even cried later that day and till today, my eyes start to tear up when I remember what he said and how he said it.As you can see, the employees cannot seem to agree or know what is going on. And when I asked them questions, I was called rude and the phone mysteriously ""hangs off"".On the same day I spoke to a lady (person n6) who spent her time trying to explain to me what (supposing) is going on.The lady told me that bank opened a dispute, on my behalf on the 12/10. I explained to the lady that I NEVER asked or even consented for my bank to open a dispute, as I have proof that I received the product and I am using it.I also explained that I can send her proof that I received the item; nonetheless, why would my bank open a dispute and I proceed the last payment on the 30/10?!IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE!!!At this point, I asked her if she could send me my information, as this is new to me and she refused claiming that emails have already been sent out.The lady then suggested that I call my bank so we can be on a 3-way call ""and she can provide them with detailed information"".I called the bank and again, they confirmed that THEY HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF A DISPUTE BEING OPENED, AT ALL!!The bank told me and the lady that the payments have been proceed and nothing has been refunded.The bank even gave me the following details:Payment Authorisation Code: 034856Payment Authorisation Ref number: 0226712352520The lady then sent me an email claiming that that was/is the dispute they received from my bank.I was shocked when I saw it!!! It is literally an email that, even I can write. It does not have my bank's detail/logo or even my name/address. It just has my PayPal account email and the amount that is being requested back.What even shocked me more is that the amount in ""dispute"" is SUPERIOR to the original charge... by like £100.I asked the lady how could they be so unprofessional and naive???How can someone dispute a charge and request more money than what they actually paid??? And PayPal closes the case in their favour??",1,2022-12-13T00:56:48.000Z,Ludmila Adão

Dealing with PayPal customer service!,"I lost my PayPal debit card. I ordered a new one I was supposed to receive it on the 27th of last month. Here it is what the 9th, 10th? I still have yet to receive the card. I called PayPal customer service and the person on the other end of the phone actually said to me, ""Okay you were supposed to receive the card on the 27th. Did you check your mailbox? Did you look and see if there is a PayPal envelope?"" and they continued to ask me ridiculous questions as if I am a complete idiot. It seems to me that these people in customer service are doing this stuff on purpose in order to get the person on the other end riled up and get them to speak in such a manner that they would be viewed as a troublesome client and treat that person as such. What a screwed up way of doing things!",1,2022-12-10T21:24:45.000Z,Jay

Great help!,"Unsure who I spoke with but the lady was extremely patient with me and helped me so much tonight.haven’t used my PayPal for almost 10 years, I had forgotten my password a long time ago and the only way to reset it was to send a security code text message to my mobile but since setting it up I have now got a new mobile number so I couldn’t even do that!I couldn’t find any way around this - I never cared because I don’t use it to make payments but I received an email today saying someone was trying to spend almost £900 on my account! So I called, explained I have a new number and I forgotten my password etc, the lady needed the last 4 digits of my bank card to access my account to update my number and password etc and to investigate this fee someone was trying to spend.. which I also had no idea what card it was linked to!From almost 10 years ago I think my bank card has changed atleast 4 times since then! Anyway, I tried remembering multiple cards I had in the past .. none worked Ofcourse! But she mentioned looking at an old payment I maybe made and which card was on the invoice, when she said that I found my last payment email receipt in my emails from 2016 for a purchase on eBay!So I logged into my eBay account and looked at my old cards I had registered with them to than boom! Found the right one and had access to my account! She has updated my mobile number and helped me reset my password aswell as put an investigation on the fees that were trying to be spent today.With all of this hard work helping me access my account she was at complete ease and also offered to stay on the line while I checked I could log in after the branch had closed at 6:30pm she said she was happy to stay and make sure I could log in, so very kind! I told her it’s ok but if I had any issues I would call back.. however I have finally after 6 years been able to log back into my account and decline that fee someone was trying to spend all because of her help! Great customer service if you ask me! Advising me on ways to try and find the card it was linked to by looking at old emails and invoices etc shows dedication to help customers because I wouldn’t have even thought about it! Or maybe I got lucky due to the other reviews, who knows but the lady I spoke to I cannot thank enough :) she was extreamly polite and professional but also very kind and genuinely wanted to help.

DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH PAYPAL !,"I paid for a transaction with PayPal because I wanted to use my Honey rewards as a partial payment. After I converted my refunds to psay Pal shopping credit, I then proceeded to pay for a purchase with PayPal.  It accepted the PayPal shopping credit as partial payment and my credit card was to be used for the balance due.  Unfortunately, PayPal chose to ignore the PayPal shopping credit and charge my credit card for the full amount of the purchase.  After speaking with their rude customer service, I was  advised that they are investigating this transaction even though it is all there.  They stole my PayPal shopping credits.

Customer service makes it a bit hard,"Dec 8 2022 - 3:00pmAfter having complained to another manager yesterday that was in agreement with me, something must have happened and he pushed this transaction along. The system had placed my payment into a 24 hour hold based on a PayPal algorithm. They has verified me several times, the sender of funds was family, but they could not release this 24 hour hold. On top of that it would take 3-5 business days to push the transaction through. Amazingly, the transaction was placed into my bank account today, just after the 24 hour hold. Someone must have expedited this after the system imposed hold was over.So good result, but a lot of headache getting there.Dec 7, 2022 - 11:30amCustomer service is the worst that I have encountered in years.I tried yesterday to log into my acccount and while I have 2FA on all my accounts, never got the SMS that Paypal sent. Tried resetting my password and the poor technology then said we can't identify who you are. Tried to online chat with CS but you needed to login. So...Then came the nightmare with calling 'customer service'. Had to confirm my identity with the first agent which was ok. Then the handover to the second agent had me doing this again. And no information was sent so had to explain my issue all over again. Handover procedure...nil.Their first step was to have me reset my password. I told them I just had. They said I did it wrong. I then asked for a manager. While they went to get their mananger (who has not replied yet), I jumped onto another operating system and browser. I then successfully logged in using Chrome on Android. I was then able to login to Paypal using Firefox on Linux, where I had issues before. The CS rep did not know Linux is an O/S. The issue with Paypal sits with Chrome on Linux it seems but the CS folks decide to blame the customer first. Sub basement support. When they came back on the line they said the manager would get in touch on my home phone. They asked for it again and I gave it to them. CS then said it was not entered properly on my record. Little did they know that I had accessed my phone # on Paypal aready (since I had solved my own issue) and it was entered correctly. So lie from CS reps.And now the kicker...as I continue to sort out what happened (I plan to ditch this poor service), I installed the PayPal app on my mobile phone. And on that device while I am logged into PayPal on Chrome, the app says it cat't identify me. Security run amok with the poor technical expertise and woeful testing.1:13pmAnd the issues continue. I have received an email from PayPal stating that they are going to hold on to my funds for an additional 24 hours for 'security review.' This is on top of the 3-5 days that is per normal. This now makes 48 hours that I will not have access to my funds due to technical reasons and now 'security'. Especially silly when they have confirmed my identity verbally, twice.

"Worst money ""service"" ever","I had a paypal account for 10 years, as I was forced to by Ebay. As I have not used them for a long time and had changed my phone number I could no longer get access to my account (thanks to their very ""helpful"" million step verification). XS were no help and told me I'd need to open a new account - which I have done. I sold something for £800 to someone using PayPal credit and the money was placed on hold. Tracking sent, item recieved. Customer has also phoned PayPal to confirm delivery and satisfaction with the item, and stated they will not be returning or asking for a refund. Money is still on hold, for security checks.... the money is coming from them as its PATPAL CREDIT!! long and short of it, they said the money can take up to 3 weeks to clear as I have a new account, but if I make 5 more sales they will speed it up. Why on earth would I use this ""service"" 5 more times? You charge me and then provide the worst experience. 3 weeks before xmas and I'm watching a screen waiting for my money to clear. Disgusting shabby 2 bit company that makes its money from holding on to yours. As soon as it clears my account will be closed and il never use these parasites again.

If you refund an item, they now keep all their fees. I always used my PayPal balance to pay my PayPal credit card, but since they take forever to process it, my balance changes in that time period and then they charge a $30 fee. The worst thing is that recently I’ll have a purchase be declined, but the funds charged anyway! Then when it goes through the second time I end up with a duplicate charge that I have to dispute with my bank.

They are not safe ( scam ),"All the reviews that state the negativity surrounding PayPal are completely true rather than some people having bad experiences with PayPal. I completely agree with all the people who state the shittiness of paypal. I created my 1st PayPal account about 2 or 3 years ago. When i recieved my 1st PayPal income from a buyer who has bought an item i listed on ebay, i never got the money ( not because of PayPal's $hitty money freezing system ) but because as it turns out the buyer of the item i listed was an account that was hijacked and not the actual buyer themselves. So the ebay account that made the purchase was a hacked account. I waited to get the money for a few days atleast or same day, soon after the purchase i think i got notifications from PayPal that the money was on hold. I also got notifications from ebay that the buyer requested a refund or the money i recieved was being refunded back to the buyer because their account was used by another person. So i then waited for the money to be sent back to the buyer in my PayPal account, but as it turns out that money was forever on hold on PayPal and the buyer was never refunded. The amount was at least 4 or 5 pounds. I was left confused as to why the money was frozen and the person never got their money back ( this will be a follow up later in this review ). I have rarely used PayPal ever since because i just wasn't bothered. But at least months later, i wanted to go on PayPal again so i went to the login screen and put in my password which was automatically saved and my email address linked with the account, but something was incorrect. I thought that i might've changed the password and forgot about it, as it turns out that never happened. So i go to the reset password page and it asks for my email. I put in the email i had with the account, but it kept saying oops something went wrong. I've tried resetting my email after that happened, but it never let me reset the email. I kept trying to log into my PayPal account by trying to reset my password and email, but they kept sucking my dick wrongly. I have kept trying to log in, i tried to contact their support but  UH OH! you have to log in to use the f*cklng support. So then i was absolutely f*cklng angry with PayPal and i have been looking up how to reset PayPal account, or log in if you have forgotten the information. I tried again, but it kept giving me an oopsie daisy something went wrong. So not long after i have been looking up reviews of PayPal and most of them were people that have been f*cklng shot in the ass by PayPal. People who have lost money over PayPal, people who never recieved their money, account problems, $hitty customer support, never getting money, money never sending, etc. So now that person who has been hacked on ebay and never got their money back from PayPal has been f*cked by PayPal same with me and most other users of it. So i have witnessed infront of my eyes a hacked ebay account give me money by PayPal, the owner of the account gets it back and gets an automatic refund of the amount that the hacker charged them with, but PayPal kept that persons money frozen and never gave it back. I have also seen reviews of people being charged money to recieve money by paypal. And business accounts taking too long to recieve money, and not all money recieved. Even though i have not witnessed most problems people have had with PayPal, i'm far from convinced that those reviews are legit. PayPal in a nutshell is what happens when a corrupt party of North Korea makes a money app for its people. I strongly suggest you don't use PayPal for any purposes. If you do to give money or recieve money, you will be f*cked either way. Giving money through PayPal has a high chance of the cash you sent being frozen by PayPal and PayPal will only get richer and richer every time they freeze money. They will get closer to becoming more worldwide and an empire if you use paypal for money purposes.",1,2022-12-01T22:02:00.000Z,Vedgehol

Now somehow I've been charged twice, the money is actually gone from my bank account, BUT I have not received my goods (which should have been immediate as they are concert tickets!) It's saying ""AUTHORISATION"" on my PayPal account with no real explanation, so I have no idea what is going on, especially as I've been charged already, but it looks right now like I've been charged a LOT for NOTHING? I've been in touch with where I bought the tickets but so far they have no answer... so I'm beyond angry and once this is sorted I'm thinking I might stop using PayPal completely going forward as I don't trust them now. UPDATE: After speaking with PayPal they blamed my bank. Called bank who said the issue was definitely PayPal and that they do this all the time! The bank had authorised the payments (which is exactly how I can see it on my account) but PayPal were holding the transaction or something. Anyway, I did not get my tickets and have now missed out completely thanks to PayPal. My friend said she has the exact same experience with them last week when buying a gift online. I will close my account now and never use them again - too risky.",1,2022-12-02T11:00:08.000Z,NP.

Due to PayPal being such a monopoly I've been forced to delete small businesses I ran that were linked with Paypal. I do not believe that Paypal should police or be the arbiters of what people can/cannot say. Furthermore, I am not confident PayPal could implement a system that'd be 100% accurate/fair in regards to enforcing this potential system. Paypal claimed this was added in error; however, weeks later it was still added to Paypal's Terms of service.

PayPal takes at least as long as the max. They can…WHY? I wonder..,"Though quite freindly I was left feeling frustrated as after I explained my issue and the formalities were done, asking what would be done he said he would pass on my problem to the relevant dept. But could do nothing to solve it! Basically, the app. Kept freezing at the point I went to carry out the transaction. Anyho, unfortunately the advisor seemed to have little knowledge about this matter and furthermore, rather than connecting me to someone who could helped, he just said he couldn’t help at that moment! The reason I used the app was because at a glance it said “money transferred in minutes” but when I got to the point of transfer it then said “transfers could take up to 72hrs” now that was Wednesday, 16thNov. It showed up today and guess when? As I went on the app it asked me for a review and after writing this once already, just when I went to check my facts at my banking app. I not only lost my review but as if by magic the funds suddenly appeared(lol).. I also received an email from PayPal stating the second part of my review(could take 72 hours depending). Now I am not saying this is in anyway deceptive but I would say it at best is misleading as if I didn’t see that money in minutes boast, I wouldn’t have used the app!! So folks to end I will say maybe call PayPal to find out how long your transfer will take before using… As my transfer took from Wednesday to Saturday(just now) and just as I was about to send this review which suddenly dissapeared and I then had to write it again!! 72hrs almost dead on give and take a few minutes!!

I'm just getting paid by an employer.  They did one ""courtesy release"" - which I told them was ridiculous.  How is it a courtesy to hand me my own money?

Made $496 today.  Called them to ask to release.  They said sorry, you have to wait 21 days.  Or, I can do something to do with ""processed shipping"" on the payment and that will release it - in a WEEK.  I don't know who these people think they are, or how they stay in business, but it's SO BAD that I have told my job that either they figure out a way to pay me that isn't through PayPal or I quit.

They told me I need to have more positive performance to receive my money immediately. I am not you employee. As I know you are working for me, I am your customer. You take almost 15% fee of my money and changed it to a wrong currency. Give back my money. Please, if you have a plan and there is Paypal in it, cancel the plan.

Atrocious customer service,"Paypal recently closed my account without warning. No specific reason given. Trying get sense out of anyone by phone is near impossible. They are polite but seem to have no power or knowledge of anything. I made a written complaint and request for an explanation but only received a pre generated message. That has spaces for information to be added by the sender that they hadn't even bothered to complete. The very vague reason it gave was now different to the original reason. I complained again and received another poorly prepared ""cut and paste"" type message that now gave yet another different vague reason. Trying to communicate sensibly with them to try and resolve an issue or at least get a proper explanation for their action is nigh on impossible. The system seems to be set up to be difficult to use and then they just avoid discussing the issue properly at all. Paypal might be great while it is working but if something goes wrong they just don't seem interested or even capable of offering any kind of worthwhile customer service. In the same sentence in one message they told me I am being banned from Paypal and am a valued customer. Work that one out. I can accept that they have to police the operation but I steadfastly believe I did nothing wrong. Looking at the rating on here and other posts all over the net it seems my experience is not an isolated one.",1,2022-11-17T12:23:05.000Z,Ian Nicholson

Zero stars,"It's nothing new, PayPal has its ill fame. But I did not expect that. They took over a 5% commission on a private money transfer and put my money on hold.

I told them I had every other piece of information that they could possibly need but they would not do anything for me because I did not have that phone number anymore.

WORST COMPANY EVER,I would give 0 If possible. I sold some Pokémon cards to someone in gumtree who paid using PayPal everything went fine till I received a refund demand from the person because I forgot a card fair enough my fault so I arranged to send her the card and go are separate ways she said that's fine no problem then 1MONTH later out of no where I get another refund demand claiming cards are fake she sent me an email showing she destroyed all the cards except the most valuable ones and wanted her money back. Long story short PayPal sided with her despite all the prove I gave everything was done correctly so she has the valuable cards destroyed all the rest and I'm having to give her the money back. So I've basically paid her to have my most valuable Pokémon cards and destroy my property.

Paypal will randomly hold on to your funds for weeks.,"I sent my friend money like I often do via PayPal. After one or two transfers they started putting the funds on hold which they said would be at most 72 hours. It's been well over a week already. The funds were gone immediately from my account and neither of us can access them. They have a different story every time we call. Most recently they said transfers from bank accounts go to a third party and they have no say in it. If they do this to lots of people, which they do, and hold on to their money for weeks, say $200 and they do that with just 20,000 customers that is 4 million dollars they can collect interest or invest or whatever. Of course we are going to use a different service (once the money gets to her), but I have heard horror stories of people losing their utilities and being charged a bunch to have them turned back on while the money is being 'held' by PayPal. I've heard of people stuck without gas or food and people who were not able to rent the apartment they found be ause they didn't have the funds they promised. PayPal is a horrible business and the best way to avoid such problems is to stop giving them business. I have heard they hold money when people buy things also which the seller pays a service fee for. It is a scam that targets that are older and/or less financially secure.

PAYPAL ARE UNCARING THIEVES AND SCAMMERS,"I've been with PayPal for 12 years but after their behaviour over the past few days they can only be described as CROOKS and SCAMMERS, there are no other words to describe them. I sent a friend in the Philippines some money by PayPal to help buy food and other necessities but when she went to collect it she found a notice saying:WE'RE PERMANENTLY LIMITING YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU CAN NO LONGER USE PAYPAL AS WE'VE DECIDED TO PERMANENTLY LIMIT YOUR ACCOUNT AFTER A REVIEW' This is disgusting, she cannot collect the money I've sent her and I cannot claim it back, so in effect PayPal are withholding money that doesn't belong to them which can only be described as STEALING customers money. How can they get away with this? They can't be above the law but it's such a huge company they feel they can throw their weight about and just keep money that doesn't belong to them. Who makes these outrageous decisions? Try contacting someone to complain to and it's virtually impossible. I described the situation to a customer service representative via their chat service and received the answer there was nothing she could do!!! In the end, to keep me quite, they have given me a £25 gift voucher as compensation which can only be used for a purchase, I can't withdraw it and I can't send it. I'm FUMING that this giant of a company has the power to ruin people's lives. Why can't they let people collect the money BEFORE they limit the account? The person in the Philippines still needs money to buy food so I'm going to have to resend it by Western Union or Cebuana, they just don't care or realise how their thoughtless actions can badly affect people. I've heard of the same thing happening to other people in the Philippines, it's a poor country and people sometimes need money urgently but PayPal couldn't care less, they unlawfully withhold money that doesn't belong to them and this has made me rethink my relationship with these scammers. I'm wary of sending any money now and they can stick their voucher where the sun doesn't shine, it's not going to put food in the mouths of poor people that need it.

This is the 2nd time I've filed a dispute with PayPal regarding an unreceived purchase and neither time have they interceded on my behalf.  PayPal claims that they offer, ""Protection you can count on.""  This protection must be for the scammers because it surely is not for the consumer.  The catch to their protection is that they also say, ""you MAY qualify for Purchase Protection, and we'll reimburse you for the full purchase price plus any original shipping costs, SUBJECT TO TERMS AND LIMITATIONS.""

It was a SCAM, and I am now managing the time-consuming process of having canceled the (Citi Bank) credit card involved and unwinding this transaction. Because of USASTAMPS affiliation with PayPal, I dropped my guard and allowed myself to be duped, for the FIRST TIME.

I use two-factor authentication and have had ZERO problems until now--using PayPal.(2) DID PayPal PERFORM DUE DILIGENCE VETTING USASTAMPS?Determining merchant authority to sell US postage stamps is incumbent upon PayPal. US postage stamps are not an obscure, esoteric product. To neglect ascertaining that USASTAMPS has authority to sell US postage stamps is blatant disregard of its customers and ignores merchantability for a specific purpose.PLEASE RESPOND TO THESE QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY.

No one at customer service will help you and they will just keep transferring you To a different department so they don’t have to do their jobs.

AVOID PAYPAL AT ALL COSTS IF YOU ARE A SMALL BUSINESS.,"AVOID PAYPAL at all costs if you run a small business. They can be exceptionally rude and put the phone down on you, then put 21 day holds on payments, they limit your account until you can provide proof of suplier, proof of forfillment and proof of what the item is. One agent will tell you how to do this and then another agent will tell you something different. To paypal sellers do not matter, paypal will always take the side of a buyer. Paypal rewarded an £800 case in the buyers favour, we appealed there decision multiple times but to no avail, the final time we contacted paypal they told us there was nothing they could do and to raise the issue with out local police, we did this and we were able to recover the funds through the police. If you are a small business paypal will throw every hurdle your way before you can get the money and they only get worse with time. Try using different payment providers like stripe etc!

Any reason not to help,I always thought using PayPal afforded you protection if you had a problem with a retailer how wrong could I be ! I have had 2 recent instances the first was a fairly minor situation where the retailer was paid more than the amount I authorised but PayPal refused the case and closed it without any appeal. Fortunately that was a small sum. Then I made a payment to a furniture retailer that has gone into liquidation. There was a delay with the order / delivery which went over 180 days from the original payment on the order. I got a rejection by return from PayPal who closed the case. The amount was over £540.,1,2022-11-10T15:51:21.000Z,Richard Edwards

Their support teams mislead me and gave me contradictory information and I could not be more disappointed.

Not a great start. Called customer service and the agent could barely understand me. I had to repeat my email address multiple times and then get told, there is no account associated with the email address. What?! I'm logged in and starting straight at the PayPal account that has that email address. I ask for a Supervisor but their busy and that they'll call me me. We all know the odds of that happening. I say I'm getting really unhappy and need to speak to someone now, another supervisor in their call center or the supervisor's manager. No one is available. I politely tell the agent that PayPal this is the worst customer service I've ever experienced and the fact that I cannot even resolve this without hoping someone will call me back is unforgivable. They lost my business - both personal and for our HOA. The worst decision they made was going entirely off shore in their CS to shave off money and having individuals that can barely understand what I'm saying.

I am fed up with the practices that PayPal implemented to disregard their customers,"I have been a long time customer of PayPal, probably since the company came to existence.  Over the years I have noticed that the company's course has changed from being a company to serve the customers to a company to use the customers for it's own gain without any consideration for the customers. PayPal changed the algorithms of their operations so that now instead of protecting a customer's interest, they first think of their own interest allowing themselves use customer's bank accounts linked with PayPal for charges for purchases or vacations because their algorithms felt that PayPal money was in danger. So it was OK to let a ""dangerous"" company to go straight for a private checking account to endanger it's contents. These occasions have become too numerous lately, so you never know if you are using PayPal for a large purchase and get to pay off your balance over 6 months period  or they just grab the last $2000 that you have in your checking account without even notifying you that they are doing that. And lately they came up with a new legend that my bank refused a transaction, so they paid for me, and when a refund was in order, they just kept the money, although originally they charge my checking account for the amount they claimed my bank refused the transaction.The customer service guys keep changing their explanations, it is difficult to get through on the phone, which makes me personally want to just close my account and be done with them. Why bother with PayPal,  if the money goes straight from my checking account, and then it takes more than 3 phone calls to PayPal and a claim with my bank to get my money back? I am seriously considering closing my PayPal. I am sure, they are so full of themselves they won't even miss me. I am fed up!",1,2022-11-03T03:48:13.000Z,Isana Loshinsky

Then I was transferred to a so-called ""Account Specialist"", never to be heard again. I was put on a line forever and never reached the so-called ""Specialist"".

During the whole process the seller impersonated me 2 to 3 times. Each time the waiting time for the hotline was very short (at most 15 seconds) and the personnel helped to the best of their ability.After we found out about the impersonation, they quickly provided actions I could do to prevent any further meddling by the seller.Then we continued on with legal steps and after roughly a week i got my roughly 1000€ back.Further legal actions might take a while though, since the gov is usually pretty slow.",5,2022-11-01T14:20:22.000Z,Nicolas Bechstedt

PAYPAL IS A THIEF,"I hate this company and specifically the customer service and the terms and conditions of Paypal. Paypal is one of the biggest and legal thiefs of this era. If you have the possibility: do NOT use Paypal. Especially for business owners. If you're calling with the customer service about clearly wrong cases, they literally just hang up the phone. I've lost over 300 Paypal cases, without even having the possibility to answer the cases. All my customers have received their products, though, Paypal closes ALL cases in my disadvantage. And the funny thing is, they count 25euros per lost case as Paypal fee. This is just theft. All customers have received their products PLUS received their money back. That in itself is wrong, but 25 euros fee times 300 customers for Paypal is just profit for Paypal, which makes it even worse. I would've given 0 stars, but 1 is the lowest we can go.

Based on personal experience only,"This review is based on my personal experience with Paypal.I recently placed an order with Graig Farms.  The order, at checkout, was for £43.  I paid using Paypal. When I checked my Paypal account, I saw that Graig Farms had charged me £48 (I've learned that they overcharge to cover the variability in the weight of their produce). I called Paypal and told them that I had not authorised a payment of £48.  Paypal told me that they had an agreement with Graig Farms that allows Graig Farms to increase the amount charged.  I then asked Paypal what was stopping any vendor with whom they have this 'agreement' from increasing the amount to £1000. The person I spoke with  consulted their Manager and Paypal's response was that if such a thing happened, I would have to resolve the matter with the vendor!I then stated to Paypal that my main reason for using Paypal was to protect the bank account associated with my Paypal account and that if they 'allow' vendors to charge whatever they want then there is no protection.  As a result of this revelation, I closed my Paypal account.  I cannot trust them to protect my bank account.",1,2022-10-31T11:47:36.000Z,Kevin Strider

They said yes and warned me that initially, I may receive a notification that I have missed a payment but I was told to ignore it as that amount will come out in my first DD but it happens while the changes are in process. After few weeks of setup the DD, I get an SMS stating I've missed a payment and that this would affect my credit report. I called Customer Service and said that I've set up a DD and explained my previous call they said its fine to ignore it. After a month I check my Credit Report and PayPal is showing that I have missed a payment. I called back as soon as I saw this and they said they will raise it with the team to get this removed and should take two months. I waited two months and its still there!

"Account Security is Terrible, Customer Service Worse","Account security is a joke, and assistance through the resolution center is horrific. In February of 2021, my paypal account was hacked into. I noticed this - not by an alert from paypal, but by finding I had about 200+ junk emails in my gmail account. I learned this is an approach hackers use - bomb your email with junk email so you do not see the emails about the fraudulent transactions occuring. I immediately checked my bank accounts, and saw multiple transfers from my paypal linked bank account. I reported this immediately to paypal. I asked them to freeze my account. They failed to do this, and additional fraudulent transfers were made. I called again, they said they submitted the case to the resolution center on my behalf. I then received an email indicating all the transactions were ""deemed non-fraudulent"".  9 months later, I have FINALLY, after tens of emails, and countless hours on the phone with incompetent, and under-empowered staff, been compensated for the nearly $6,000 USD which they allowed to be transferred out of my account to an unknown, unidentifiable wells fargo bank account.

Unfair return policies for large international purchases,"I bought a manual tread mill in March for £396 from an online store domiciled in Spain.It was a Manual tread mill  which was advertised as being very durable, to my chagrin it became faulty only after 5 days of use! The seller advertised a refund policy of 1 year post purchase so i contacted them immediately to report the issue .I have been chasing a refund for circa 6 months and was told I’d I’ve to ship the item back to Spain to process the refund - I find this impractical as I had paid £96  import duty/shipping cost of £46 to collect the item  and I was asked to bear further costs to return a large item to Spain from the UK at a cost which would eclipse the refund I’m seeking in the first place .I tried to dispute the transaction with PayPal and they upheld the seller’s policy that I had to return the item at my own expense . After a very stressful process of seeking a refund Paypal suggested that I complain to the Financial Onbudsman if I was not satisfied with the outcome of the dispute claim .To my further consternation the investigator at the financial Onbudsman service ruled in favor of PayPal citing a return policy by PayPal  that I was unaware of -‘ that PayPal may require you to ship back an item at your expense ‘!I’d like to advise prospective international buyers to be aware of this unfair return policy as I was not aware of it , this was not explicitly stated in their return policy .As an unwary international consumer I feel exploited to say the least !As a consumer who trusted a brand like PayPal I feel so disappointed and pained that consumer protection policies that apply elsewhere ( i have had a similar experience and my bank granted a refund in my favor as the seller clearly sold a dysfunctional product which was not fit for purpose ) did not apply in this instance .This unfair return policy is in no way supportive of the consumer’s right especially when you chose a platform like PayPal for payments in hopes that if a transaction goes wrong your rights as a consumer would be preserved  . This policy unilaterally favors the seller to the detriment of the consumer .",1,2022-10-24T11:40:40.000Z,Emiloju

I asked which website violated their TOS so I can remove their code from their and continue using them for my other websites which are all online advertising related. One was selling MLM targeted leads so they banned all my sites + myself as a person forever.They were charging me 4% for processing + 4% for exchange rate converting USD into EURO when withdrawaing to my local bank so total 8% was already a good reason not to appreciate their business practices.With 3D secure cards, I do no longer need Paypal actually since I started using Paypal 15 years ago to protect myself from credit card fraud.

Probably the worst customer experience ever encountered!!,"Probably the worst customer service experience that I've ever encountered with regards to any online payment processing service!I took out a dispute against a non-responsive eBay seller early Oct 2022 for sending me shoddy goods which was supposed to arrive in excellent condition, as described and advertised, that set me back £299.99 and the seller themselves refusing to refund me directly despite the supposed eBay ""money back guarantee"" consumer safeguard.The dispute itself remained outstanding for almost three weeks until the case was eventually closed in my favour after supplying a mound of evidence that included copies of all return documentation with added full Royal Mail tracking info and plenty of detailed photos of the beyond shoddy laptop itself and the pathetic packaging that it was despatched in.But although the eventual outcome was good news on my behalf I still had to wait another 5 days before I finally received my refund of 299.00 into my associated account... a pound short of what i had initially paid and had requested back!It's clear that customer service is irrelevant to this so-called global payment giant and would be surprised if this company survives for much longer considering the competition out there that out performs paypal on all fronts!!All in all: Paypal (in my opinion after personal experience) is by no means a pal of any customer... especially consumers!!After this experience I can honestly say that I would never use PayPal and have since reviewed how I pay online and who I buy from.Personal note: Customer Service - 0Beware all consumers... a slow and pathetic service considering the size of such a global company.",1,2022-10-27T11:48:30.000Z,J D Shanks

PayPal is incompetent.,"The new business my husband and I own recently invoiced our second client via PayPal, per the client’s request. The invoice went to the client with no issue. Unbeknownst to us, PayPal took 3.5% of the total amount. As annoying as that was, even more frustrating was the fact that we were told we couldn’t withdraw the funds for 3 weeks. It was explained to me by someone at the company that they have to make sure our business wasn’t a “risk” for PayPal until we’ve made a total of 10 transactions. I let them know we’re making our client wait to begin building their instrument bc of their “policy”. Also, 9 more transactions would take forever bc of both the slow nature of our new business (crafting high-end musical instruments) and the fact that we typically invoice through our QuickBooks account. That sealed the deal for us to no longer use PayPal once we received the money. The balance was available after about 2 weeks instead of 3, but then I was informed that a transfer might not go through because the name on the business bank account didn’t match the name of the PayPal account (I recently changed my name to my married name, and am still changing everything related, incl our business bank account). I contacted Paypal to ask if I needed to do anything to ensure the transfer would go through because of this, and was essentially told to try it and see. Lol that’s no help, I was trying to avoid having any issues but the individual could offer no help beyond, “just try and see”. The transfer did go through, thankfully, but the latest issue arose when trying to close the account. PayPal blocked the account closure and I was told today that there was a “wall” put up by the company bc they needed to verify my identity. I had verified my married name change with the appropriate documents, so why they again need me to verify my identity is a bit ridiculous. Today, I was given instructions on how to upload the documents, but they made no sense. I was told to look for the notification bell to address the issue when no notification bell existed in my web browser. I was alternatively given a link to click and upload the docs. I clicked the link but the page read, “Thanks! You’re all set. Everything checked out…” I remarked on this and asked for either a working link or an email address to send the docs to. The next cust svc associate reiterated the instructions with some ALL CAPS to look for the NOTIFICATION BELL. I again had to reiterate it didn’t exist, then sent a screen shot to prove it. If they had actually read what I wrote previously, we could’ve skipped that entirely. Only after that did I get the working link and an email address I had previously asked for. I’ve uploaded the docs and am waiting to get the all clear so that we can close our business account. I’ve had no problem with PayPal over the years until now. I have lost all confidence in this company and am, sadly, expecting more issues before being able to close the account. I don’t trust them with my info and I don’t trust their competency.",1,2022-10-17T21:18:00.000Z,Nikki

So here is some common sense PayPal..is it better to be mailed to a stranger just because they have a physical mailing address?!?!?! I actually have both a physical mailing address and P.O. box. They won't mail my card to my P.O. box......so I said fine just mail it to my physical address but write down the P.O. box or it will get sent back..what did they do?? wrote the physical address down only and it was sent back!!!!!! So then I told them they could pay to have it delivered since they wanted to be such jackarses but they didn't want to pay for it...so now I will find a better company that doesn't keep u on hold for 45 minutes, and will actually do a better job at protecting my security because t won't need a stranger to mail it to in the hopes I would get it!!!! My advice is to find someone better and to look around.

Now, on day 10- it seems you can't even talk to customer service because their lines are breaking up as you try to talk with them...I highly doubt that is coincidental.Completely corrupt and fraudulent company who holds consumers hostage by refusing to close their accounts- We never had pending charges or shadow accounts- I pulled the legwork off to prove that- only for them to 'change' their excuse.

Paypal Has Sealed Their Own Fate,"I have tried to log in to my Paypal account more than 50x this week.  In endless security prompt loop to verify I am human.

When you think you're getting somewhere, another box with animated animals, bat, lion to prove you are human. I tried over the course of days this week and today, 16 October 2022 it comes up with 403 Forbidden message. I completed Paypal's complaint form and copied and paste the 403 Forbidden message too, when I clicked submit, it has 403 Forbidden. You can try yourself. The links in the complaint form, also came up with 403 Forbidden.  It is despicable for a business that is trusted to manage financial transactions is not allowing customers to access their own accounts. I cannot make any transactions as it will not allow you to log in, even if you get as far as putting in your password and back to security verify prompts. They cannot do this forever and as soon as Paypal lets me in, I will delete my account. What is the purpose of Paypal if you cannot pay sellers? They have a lot of bad publicity and people are deleting their accounts en masse and they have now made a bad situation worse, by not allowing customers to do Any transactions. On the complaint form, I do recall that Luxembourg is the regulator/supervisor and that will be my next step.Paypal have sealed their own fate by their actions to include most, if not all their customers because they claim the fine they included in their terms and conditions was included in error and reversed; so why can't I log in?",1,2022-10-16T16:08:39.000Z,MissD

If you have been defrauded by PayPal,"It is important to realize that PayPal makes a substantial amount of revenue through fraud, probably between 10 and 15 percent of it.  The bad experiences posted on this and other sites are not mistakes - they are intentional.If you have had money stolen by PayPal, you may benefit for requesting arbitration as detailed in the terms of service.  PayPal must pay all of the costs of the proceeding upfront if you ask them to.  Overall, it is an easy process, and it is likely you will get relief.",1,2022-10-13T04:01:21.000Z,Matthew Hodge

Lost money on blatant scam PayPal did not resolve and sided with the scammer!,"My complaint wasn’t upheld when I blatantly got sent a product that was nothing like the description. I e an XL dog paddling pool that was the sameSize as a small bowl. The company said they were refunding me but didn’t, they were just burning down the time to this 12 day waiting period that once it expires no recourse can apparently be taken. As ordained by the almighty pay pal, they seem to think they make their own rules. Computer says no apparently. The system won’t allow you to reopen a resolution. What nonsense. Shame on PayPal for perpetuating scams and siding with them against an honest customer. I have a funny photos of my dogs bum just about fitting into this ‘paddling pool’. Lol I m still considering regulator input but with the death of my father and hospital issues I haven’t got the fight to get £30 back. Paypals processes should be helping me not the opposite.

It says that I will get money after 1 day of a delively, but the service cannot be delivered, it's not an item. I ask customer to confirm a delively, he says that payments that he sent doesn't have such an option. I ask him to send me money like a person to person, after I refund him. I refund him, and his money also get on hold. Because he payed with a debit card, so now he has to wait for 30 days till money are returned. No option to put them to PayPal account. Finally he puts more money in PayPal and sends me a regular transfer. Money are put on hold again on my account. Amazing! Now I have to wait 21 days and he has to wait 30 days.If i send invoice, and money are to be put on hold, there should be a warning, nobody's going to recheck 10x times the ToS of PayPal.When money are returned, there should be an option to select where they are to be returned.",1,2022-10-11T00:13:15.000Z,GameRz

"They don't care anymore, never ever PayPal for me","Winter 2021I ordered an item through eBay Germany which was supposed to be brand new, I got instead a damaged item. I claimed that to PayPal and were asked to send it to eBay Luxemburg and I would pay for the shipment. I couldn't beleive that I would send the item to another country, I checked the address on Google Maps and it was a regular house in Luxemburg, it didn't look like an office. I contacted eBay Germany and it was very strange they said. I Contacted PayPal several times and they tried to force me to send it to Luxemburg, until last day one agent gave me ""correct"" address in Germany. I sent the item back to the seller, the package never arrived and was sent back to me because of wrong address.Because the package never arrived, I lost my money and had paid extra for the shipment. PayPal closed the case. I called and told them that I did as they said, it was really hard to me to convince them that I did as they said and followed the instructions in details, it didn’t help. I called several times until one agent took it seriously and went through the files that I had attached; he reopened the case and asked the decision makers to take another look into the attached files. Apparently, PayPal avoided the info I provided them about the track ID and photos of everything and just closed the case. It was then, after the case was reopened and what the agent wrote to decision makers helped me to be refunded. Summer 2022:I purchased a lot of items from a store, one of the items was out of stock and would be shipped later wrote the store, the item costs around €60. And in the store's ad they ”promised” one free additional item worth around €40 when a backpack was purchased which I did.I received everything except the item out of stock which was expected, and the ""free"" addtional item was missing. The store said it’s only for local customers which the didn’t mention it in their ad. I claimed that to PayPal, the store first agreed to refund then asked to send back the items that I purchased. PayPal asked me to send back the items worth around 500€ to get my 100€ for the two missed items (the one I paid for and the free one). I asked them to read the conversation between me and the store which I had attached, they refused to do it. I told the agent about previous case in winter 2021 that was reopened, it seems your are not browsing the files that I'm attaching? The answer was no, the case is closed, contact the store instead.

There are so many reasons I hate…,"There are so many reasons I hate PayPal, it's exhausting just thinking about it. Terrible customer service. Long waits to speak to anyone. If you don't want to call and want help through their message center, don't bother, I repeatedly got disconnected from messaging. They DO NOT listen to you. They lie; for example, I used the 6 month financing and my extra payments always gone towards the special finance purchase, then all of a sudden it didn't. They said they only do that when it is a month before the promo rate ends. That is a lie because the way I used it, I wouldn't have been able to pay it off in one month since I used it for big purchases. I would always make my minimum and then a large amount to pay towards the promo purchase each month for 6 months, every time any extra would go to my promo purchase balance. I called and a rude representative lied to me and said they never had it set up that way and disregarded anything I had to say to him, he gave zero *ucks. Honestly, it seemed like a joke to him, like he enjoyed being disagreeable. I stopped using their credit because this seems very scam like if you ask me. Trying to make a buck by tricking people into interest rates, I'm all set. Anyway, separate issue, I am on hold for an hour now because I can't use messaging center, it's a waste of my valuable time, the first representative would not listen to me. I repeatedly told him that I sent my daughter $60 two times, and since PayPal would not let her deposit it from PayPal to her bank account she refunded both payments. One $60 charge was deducted from my account, the other was not. The representative kept telling me no, we didn't take money out, we covered the charge. Each time I explained to him that I had a $60 withdrawal from PayPal the day after I sent it to her. It was as if he didn't listen to me at all because he would repeat the exact same thing like a script ""we did not deduct the funds, we temporarily covered the charge for you."" Apparently two separate transactions and two refunds was entirely too much for him. I asked him to connect me with someone who would actually listen to me, so here I am waiting and waiting and waiting because of their faulty system and incompetent reps. I'm canceling my account. They are not worth the hassle. I hate them. Seriously. Hate them. There is more, I just can't anymore.

It is them that is holding the funds. PayPal is terrible.” When I called PayPal back they still tried to say that it was my bank until I called them out. They then changed their story and said it was being held to make sure the funds cleared. They have HAD $3600 of MY money for THREE DAYS and are trying to say they want to make sure it “clears” ?????? They also said they have NO way to tell me when it will clear and that they cannot do ANYTHING to speed up the process of releasing my money.

Le comento que una cuenta de muchos años de antigüedad sin ningún tipo de reclamo, un solo reclamo sin base y les demostré que teníamos razón, entonces la persona me dice que he vendido menos en los últimos meses, por ello me retienen el dinero, y realmente no es que venda menos sino que uso otras plataformas con mejores beneficios y sobre todo mejor atención, pues ya vengo viendo como cada vez es peor usar Paypal. Como agencia de desarrollo de tiendas online y soluciones web, no recomendare Paypal ni instalare en nuestros aplicativos, pues si cada cliente debe estar pasando por esa pérdida de tiempo por sus caprichos no tiene sentido usar esa plataforma. / Mal por ellos, pésimo servicio y los que atienden unos patanes.

Even so, I take the trouble and waste of time to call the client and ask him to take the trouble to call Paypal, my client is told by Paypal that everything in his account is fine, the money was debited and he should not do More, I call again and support (which by the way treats you badly) says that you can't do more than wait 21 days. I tell him that an account of many years old without any type of claim, a single claim without basis and I showed them that we were right, then the person tells me that I have sold less in recent months, that is why they withhold my money, and It's not really that I sell less, but that I use other platforms with better benefits and, above all, better service since I've been seeing how it's getting worse and worse to use Paypal. As an agency for the development of online stores and web solutions, I will not recommend Paypal or install it in our applications, because if each client must be going through that waste of time due to their whims, it makes no sense to use that platform. / Too bad for them, lousy service and those who serve some louts.

Most people don’t realize using PayPal is so risky.,"PayPal is beyond terrible. It’s extremely easy to lose money when using PayPal. There are countless horror stories on the Internet about it. Just look at all the one-star reviews here on Trustpilot! Page after page after page of one-star complaints. PayPal is thoroughly despised!The only time I use PayPal is when I have no choice. That is, sometimes my credit card won’t work for a certain merchant, which forces me to use PayPal. I had to do that a couple of weeks ago.There are so many security issues when using PayPal, a book could be written about it. First off, to link your bank account, they want your bank’s login and password. That’s insane!! Luckily, I’m smart enough not to give out that kind of information to anyone. But PayPal pushes very hard to get it from you. So I have to assume the majority of people do it. They probably trust PayPal to keep it secure. (All those poor suckers will one day regret having done that.)As far as them having my credit card number, I delete it as soon as my transaction is complete. Although I’m sure a talented hacker could get all that information anyway. It’s not like PayPal erases it from their records when you delete it from your account. I am a computer expert by profession, having worked in various financial institutions for over 40 years. Trust me when I say you should be very careful with computer transactions; especially where your money and identity are concerned. Don’t give your bank account number to anyone, because doing so risks hackers one day cleaning you out.PayPal offered me five dollars to open an account. But to get that money wasn’t worth all the hassle. You can’t just spend funds in a PayPal account with a PayPal transaction. Oh, no! That would be far too reasonable. Instead, you have to specifically transfer the money directly to your bank. That’s where the risk starts. Linking PayPal with your bank account is a very risky thing to do. To be cautious, I have a separate account at my bank for risky transactions. I keep only one dollar in it, except when I need to use it. Last month, some hacker tried to withdraw $65 from that account. Luckily for me, my bank rejected it. That’s a perfect example of why I keep a special account to give access to outsiders I don’t trust, like PayPal. Should anyone get that information, I can only lose the one dollar kept in the account.As for PayPal, the instructions on their website don’t work. Instead, they pressure you to open all sorts of crazy accounts. You wind up going in circles trying to find out how to get your money. Take my advice—be very careful whenever you use PayPal.I was finally able to transfer my $5 to my bank account, but was forced to use their app on my iPhone to do so. I’ll be closing that bank account after I get my five dollars. When PayPal has that bank account number, I know it’s no longer safe to use.PayPal was started by the same crooks that created eBay. In my opinion, both were created by criminals, for criminals. (The kind of white collar criminals who never end up in jail where they belong.)If you value your identity and security, stay away from PayPal.Far, far away!",1,2022-09-20T06:14:27.000Z,Jackjack

Reviewing as a merchant,"Reviewing as a merchant. We've taken the decision to pull the plug and remove Paypal from our website. We bust our balls to give good customer service. We ship all orders promptly and in most cases everything runs smoothly. Very occasionally Royal Mail deliveries are delayed or even lost. It's a fact of life and nothing we can do about it. Because most of our deliveries are free (to the customer), we don't use a tracked method so we need to allow Royal Mail up to 10 working days for delivery. This is what Royal Mail allows before an items is considered lost. If the item is not delivered within 10 working days, we'll issue a full refund or reship, depending on the customers wishes. Unfortunately thought, despite all this information being in our terms and conditions and despite the fact that UK Consumer law allows up to 30 days for delivery, Paypal allow customers to raise a dispute at any time after the order is placed and actively encourage customers to escalate it to a claim. Why would they do this you ask. Well it's because Paypal now charge £12.50 for every claim made against a merchant. What this means is that a customer can raise a dispute just a couple of days after placing an order, immediately escalate that to a claim without any time allowed for us to respond and try to resolve the issue and even if we issue an immediate refund we will be charged £12.50. You just can't win. Paypal are extorting money from UK merchants and it's no wonder that they have removed themselves from the Financial Ombudsman Services Voluntary Jurisdiction. I guess they don't like being charged when customers complain about them. I guess Paypal are desperate to claw back the money they are loosing when eBay ditched them.To all merchants out there. Get rid of Paypal. They are no longer relevant in 2022. It's easy to get a proper merchant account and payment provider and I can assure you that customers that want to buy your goods will not leave just because you don't accept Paypal.As a customer these days, I rarely use Paypal (even if a merchant offers it).

Pay Pal Holds Your Money After Delivery,"I’ve had a Pay Pal account for 25 years. I sold 2 cameras 9/4/22 and they were both delivered 9/9/22.

Holding customer funds after a transaction is completed and delivered is simply stealing interest on hold accounts. Don’t be fooled.

Use this PAYPAL at your own risk!!!!!!!! READ REVIEWS!,Use this company at your own risk. They shut my 9 year old account without a reason. I followed up and even submitted all the required documentation but it was all in vain. USE PAYPAL AT YOUR OWN RISK! OR make sure you withdraw your funds unless you want them to shut it with your money in there. Used to think people criticize PayPal unfairly until this happened to me. I know they reserve the right to shut an account but why not at least tell me what I violated? Why are you rude to a 9 year customer? Is this how a company is run? Slowly this company will go down for mistreating customers. These reviews here are enough evidence that something is wrong with this company.

No longer an adequate service.,"I used to be quite impressed with Paypal. They had a good buyer protection policy that was clearly articulated, and it was reasonably easy to contact them when things go wrong.Not so any more. I have had several issues with them recently, but at the heart of all of those is the utter impossibility of communicating with them in any sensible grownup manner. Like many online platforms they have started using an automated chat-bot, which is almost always completely unable to resolve your issue and drives you up the wall by sending you around in circles. And if you aren't able to resolve your issue with the chat-bot easily it resorts to repeatedly just saying ""thank you"" - over and over, ignoring your further attempts to activate its issue recognition software. Apart from the diabolical and completely pointless and time-wasting chat-bot, there is no way to send them a message or an email. So, if you are unlucky enough to have to work for a living (as most of us do) and do a job that doesn't allow you to spend an hour on the phone during the day trying to resolve a Paypal issue (as many of us do), and don't get home until late evening due to a commute or busy work period - you are stuffed.When you do finally get to speak to a human you are already at the end of your tether. I wish I could say that Paypal is the only place that this has happened, but it seems to be commonplace these days and I am guessing that it's due to a combination of staff shortages, greed and incompetence.Dear Paypal - most of your customer's work for a living, so try making yourself available at a time that they are. And if you can't deliver then don't offer the service. If you don't have the staff then cut something back until you reach a level of business where you are able to provide an adequate customer service (as every small business is having to do right now – only the greedy incompetent multi-nationals are arrogant enough to think that they don’t need to do this too). It's not rocket science. This is not acceptable. I don't expect you to work 24/7, but I do expect to be able to communicate with you.",1,2022-09-14T22:21:26.000Z,Owen

PayPal A Den Of Thieves,We have used PayPal as a payment Option for our small business customers for 8 years. We've literally had millions go thru PayPal with never a problem nor a complaint. We recently advised our customers that we prefer another payment option. Yesterday we found out that PayPal is holding our funds in which we paid them 2.99%. After being on hold for 35 minutes we finally got a live person. We inquired why were funds we usually received in minutes was on hold for 21 business days. We were shocked when we learned that PayPal decided since we were using another preferred payment option for our customers that our company was now considered at risk. In other words PayPal is holding company funds that we paid for (2.99%) and floating hundreds of millions of dollars in their interest bearing account earning millions for PayPal without our knowledge or authorization.

They agreed to pay me half. 1 day later, I sent reply back I agree to that deal but the closed the case again to avoid to pay me and waste my time of open and reopen the disputes many times.

Terribly designed & Unintuitive,"PayPal imo is terribly designed and unintuitive. I recently used it to fundraise money for the first time. Before I did this I rang customer service, explained I was a novice and told him what I wanted to do, and asked him to help me set up my account. I successfully fundraised the money, went to transfer it to my bank account, when I discovered I needed to first register my bank account, which would take several working days. I was on a tight timeline and the customer service agent hadn't told me I'd need to do this, or helped me do it that day on the phone with him.For me a marker of good customer service is that the person you're speaking to knows what you don't know and can proactively assist you to navigate their service and set-up everything you need to. So at the 11th hour I tried to link my bank account. However my bank (Swedbank) has an account number that didn't fit into the field on their website. I rang customer service again and the agent was like 'oh yeah well you need to link your bank account obvs' and then when I told him my problem he said 'oh is it Swedbank? Yeah so you need to just enter the number minus the first two digits' or something like that. And I'm thinking like, why don't they have a drop-down menu where you enter your bank name, at which point the programme recognizes your bank and therefore how many digits your account number will be, and changes the 'enter account number' field accordingly?! Like, do I need to wait over an hour on the phone for someone to tell me how to do it like it's a secret club or something... just seems like SUCH an inefficient system.In the end I luckily was able to borrow the money from a friend at the last minute. That was a couple of months ago. Fast forward to today and I had some money to transfer PayPal->Bank and I got caught in a verification loop. I rang customer service and she's like, oh yeah we know, it seems to work in the mobile app tho. I explain I'm maxed out on my mobile storage, but wonder out loud whether I can download the PayPal app for my MacBook via the App Store. She's like 'oh yeah sure do that'. I look (with her waiting on the phone) but can't find it there, she's like 'oh yeah it'll be there'. I google it and discover they have the app for mobile and iPad but not MacBook. I tell her this info and say 'this could be good for you to know too'. I'm just... flabbergasted at how incompetent and powerless to help the customer service is. I pray I never need to use PayPal for anything remotely important to me ever again.For the record the customer service peeps have always been super nice when I speak to them, I imagine they're probably just underpaid people trying their best with a bad system.",1,2022-09-08T15:49:09.000Z,Bea

PayPal sides with pimps & prostitutes for profit,"My young adult autistic son accidentally feel for a prostitution scam, thinking it was a Japanese woman interested in him and a real date at a hotel. He wasted $380 total, which was my money and I was upset. After it became clear to me that it was later a prostitution scam (the woman used pictures of a Fillipina Instagram model), and when she offered blantant sex rather than spending the weekend together, my son and I realized the PayPal had a man's name and sounded very pimp-like. PayPal turned down my case and sided with the pimp saying ""no suspicious activity"" and ""lack of evidence"". PayPal legit sided with a pimp, even after I showed EVERYTHING to PayPal. I can't make this up. Of that $380 payment, PayPal made $40 from it. So now PayPal accepts prostitution and sex scams because they get a slice of the money pie. I'll NEVER use PayPal again, and still no refund after 4 days and the PayPal support ghosted me. The pimp got my autistic son's money.",1,2022-09-07T06:21:00.000Z,Chris

Was waiting on the company that was giving me a report on the faulty item so I could send to PayPal for them to close it in seller favour early morning on the 3rd day witch was Sunday. I called PayPal and told them the bloke on the phone was good and reopened the case he sorted the info out that I sent. But within the following day case closed in seller favour whitch now I've lost 250 pound . Second claim I put in was that the item was posted but was delivered to a different house I also provided them with the picture showing this ect yet again closed case in sellers favour that was another 150 pound I was not happen and phoned and phoned had rude people on the phone and many times they hung up on me. Even tho you are pay to protect your money they will still take your money and not help or investigate the cases these people are getting away with scammers PayPal is not protecting there good willing customers if they don't sort these 2 cases out I will take them to the small claims court good customer service no chance so I hope to hear back from paypal and see where it goes,1,2022-09-05T22:01:19.000Z,Chris Baker

They will not even allow me to open a dispute and protect myself with the buyers account that is clearly associated with their website. I have proof and documentation of everything and they could really care less! PayPal should really have a better system to protect all parties from fraud because this is ridiculous! Also to make matters worse, the PayPal agents inform me that they have received multiple calls in the past few months of sellers with similar issues and they have not placed protections to inform users of PayPal of this issue! If they knew their likeliness was being duplicated and causing issues why not inform both sellers and buyers of this issue as funds are requested and sent!

For 5-8 years, they made STUPID money skimming 20 pence and 3% of all my sales on eBay (I sold digital goods, so 20 pence by itself was like 15%).Upon having my account closed I tried to calculate how much Paypal made out of me as an eBay seller. The amount is somewhere in the region of £25,000.Around a year after eBay have their own system and aren't reliant on THESE ABSOLUTE SCUMBAGS, my account is closed permanently.To be ""ABSOLUTE SCUMBAGS"", when your competition is eBay is... comical.

Paypal scammed me,"Paypal scammed me. Initially I was scammed by another company (vipper.com), but I was suspicious before I made my purchase on their website, so to be safe I paid via Paypal as I wanted to make sure I could easily get my money back if it turned out to be a scam, which it was. I filed for a refund through Paypal and then suddenly 15 days later I get another email from Paypal saying that the deadline for escalating my claim was yesterday and now it is impossible to reopen the case. I received NO email from Paypal warning me that I would need to escalate the claim within a certain amount of time or else I would lose all right to get my money back. Apparently in the first email I received from Paypal confirming that I had filed for a refund if I had scrolled to the bottom I could have read that I needed to escalate the claim before 14 days or else all was lost. But even if I had read that (which NO ONE reads) it still did not say that you can ONLY ESCALATE A CLAIM AFTER 7 DAYS! So was I supposed to have logged on to my Paypal every day to see if today was the day that I could finally escalate my claim?? This is obviously a way for Paypal to trick their customers into not realizing that they need to ""escalate"" their claim, by not telling you when it's even possible to escalate and also by putting the escalation deadline (which is IMPORTANT INFORMATION!) at the bottom of an email and also sending no warning emails that you are about to lose your right to escalate your claim.

Archaic trolls. It's never been smooth with them. Ever.,"These trolls placed a client's payment to me on hold because I deliver my services digitally instead of with a carrier like UPS, FedEx, etc. They need to ""verify"" that I delivered the services I had been paid for. Anywhere else (in 2022 digital up to date financial land,) a bank would contact the payer, not the payee, to confirm that a transaction was legit. If there's a suspicious transaction using my credit or debit card, I get a call or a text. These trolls instead contact ME and demand to know if I deserve to be paid. What a convoluted backward sluggish system. If my client had told me they intend to use Paypal to pay me, I would have asked that they write s check instead. Paypal has nearly always found some s**t way to hold my money and make me jump through hoops to get paid. Then the criminals have the nerve to charge me a ""service"" fee.  Yes, a fee for keeping me from getting paid. I wonder how they profit from that? How much per year do these scum make in interest on funds placed on hold?

PAYPAL allow FAKE USERS TO TRANSFER MONEY TO PAYPAL FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTS. PAYPAL FAILS Their SECURITY,I'm liaising with PAYPAL but they keeps telling me it's not their fault for a fraud transaction without my permission. PayPal knows that some accounts are fraudulent but they fail to warn their users. And they allow their users to transfer all their PayPal money to PayPal fraudulent accounts without double-checking with their users. PayPal fails their security system and fails to protect their clients.I have used PayPal for so many years and trusted them fully but this makes me think that they are deliberately allowing fraudulent users to have PayPal and steal money with fraudulent transfers by hacking accounts. So be aware of PayPal and don't connect it to any cards or leave money in PayPal account. They will tell you that the fake account has been reported many times to their Security Department but they can't return your money... BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.,1,2022-08-09T21:02:30.000Z,Myry Miriam

Thiefs. Will ruin your Buisness. 0 star,"Absolute thiefs. After using Paypal Business account for  2 months, they suddenly decided to permanently limit my account providing false reasons and told that my funds will be held for 6 months. I was having about $100-$120 in my account, with no chargebacks or refunds history on my account. I tried calling them, they picked up the call and made me feel like I am a criminal because I used Paypal for my business. After having talks for 10-15 minutes, they suddenly hung up the call. I tried contacting them again and guess what, they stopped receiving my calls. I tried messaging them on live chat and everytime I got only bot response . I tried mailing few mails on different email addresses i found from internet and again no reply from them as well. THEY BLOCKED ME COMPLETELY.I was no longer able to talk to real person. So I just decided to wait for 6 months because no option were left at that time. After 3 months what i saw is all my held fund was transferred to thief company PayPal and i was left with 0 balance. Again i was not able to contact them. I tried registering a complaint with BBB and waited for 1 month for their response and finally someone from PayPal replied to my concern. They decided to just keep Limit on my account as it is and decided not to give my money back, because according to them I was a criminal who used Paypal for my legit business. So BBB was not able to help me at all. 2 months passed and I logged in my account to remove my debit card and bank account details. I was not able to remove them even after 6 months. I kept getting message to contact customer care, the customer care which was blocked for me completely. So only way to get their attention on my case was to contact via BBB. I filed a complaint and asked Paypal to let me remove my card and account details. Again after waiting for almost 1 month, I got a ridiculous response. They told me that, ""you can't remove your details because your account is limited and your card and bank details will stay with paypal forever."" Literally, wth is this! They don't want my business and don't want me to use PayPal but they want my card and bank details. SOUNDS LIKE A THIEF. Isn't it? Paypal gave me worst experience of my life. Through this whole process I went through lots of reviews from different websites and found that even LLC's and Private LTD companies got Banned from PayPal and even their money were stolen by them.So my suggestion for everyone will be stop using Paypal and completely boycott them. Use Stripe or anything else instead, but not PayPal. This crooks will end up taking your hard earned money away from you. Not sure how they even exists after doing so many robberies.

Apple not interested. Also left a review about them. Looked up if I have any rights. Which I do under the Consumer Act. Made a claim under section 75. Advising PayPal that my phone is not fit for purpose as whenever I use it calls are breaking up & the other person cannot make out what I’m saying. Despite providing evidence of issues raised with Apple and network provider. PayPal say I haven’t proven my case.Have gone to the Financial Ombudsman. But PayPal users need to know the following;“We are withdrawing from the Voluntary Jurisdiction of the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) on 1 December 2022. This means that if your complaint relates to an event that occurred before 1 January 2021 and you are unhappy with how we have addressed that complaint in this final response, you must refer that complaint to the FOS before 1 December 2022 if you would like FOS to look at it”.What does this suggest ? Less organisation’s to help the lowly UK consumer when dealing with companies like this.I know I’m a little fish in a big pond, concerning this situation. As soon as a decision is reached by the Ombudsman I will be closing my account. They won’t care. But it will make me feel a lot better.

No bank in the entirety of the world holds funds this long for ANY transaction. Especially for somebody who has a long history and by virtue of that has given PayPal so much money in fees over the years. For me, this is the last straw. The minute this payment clears, I will transfer it to my account and close my PayPal account permanently. They will NEVER get another dime of my money ever again.",1,2022-08-05T01:07:22.000Z,Andrew Spark

PP deducts their cut, then is freezing the rest for 21 days. Are you kidding me?!!! I called them and they say: ""... nothing we can do"". THAT'S MY MERCHANT PROCESSOR OF ALMOST 20 YRS?

PAYPAL CATERS TO HACKERS AND SCAMMERS- DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY,"A few months ago, my PayPal account received a payment of $500,unbeknownst to me. PayPal actually sent me an email directly telling methey were freezing the funds because they looked suspicious. In theprocess of maybe 3 days, the person who sent the money filed acomplaint because they wanted their money back. During that timeframe, I was unable to resolve the complaint that was filed due to beingsick with COVID and EXTREMELY long hold times when trying to connectdirectly with PayPal. I did not want to resolve the dispute online because Iwas in fear that someone was trying to hack my account and access mybanking information. Due to not being able to resolve this issue in atimely manner, PayPal charged me a dispute fee and REFUSED to helpme resolve it and remove the negative balance. They continuously kepttrying to have me supply them with my card information and/or go onlineto pay the balance off. Again, from the moment the outrageous paymentwas sent to my account, I was afraid to even access my PayPal account,input any bank information or take care of this situation before it was sentoff to collections. Well, that is exactly what happened. This balance hasnow been sent to collections. This company DOES NOT protect theirconsumers and enables hackers to send fraudulent payments in order togain access to a victims bank account.",1,2022-08-04T17:48:38.000Z,Christy Patrick

Rubbish con artists,Rubbish. I have used PayPal for years to make online purchases without problems. When I decided to sell my laptop on gumtree because its a great bargain I had interest within an hour and had sold it to someone. They made the payment to PayPal and PayPal decided to put the payment on hold and I don't get paid for 21 days. I have cancelled sale and informed the buyer that I'm not sending laptop and am cancelling sale. So basically PayPal trust me when I'm spending my money and buying from online traders but when it comes to me being trusted when selling they put my money on hold. Ridiculous. So PayPal just lost me £600 and the buyer has lost a bargain. I'm not going to use PayPal anymore and will close my account and delete the app. If you want quick cash don't use PayPal,1,2022-08-04T12:23:49.000Z,Ian batman

Avoid paypal - Unless you're a masochist,"Why is paypal is a horrible company?1. While attempting to login, paypal ""can't confirm it's you"".This happens several times a month. No attempt by the paypal site to have me verify anything. Just a big ""NOPE"". So you have to phone them and have the customer service agent verify it's you.Which means they ask you to confirm things like: credit card number, phone number, address, etc.. What, in effect, they are doing is logging into your account at their end. Why the *** doesn't the website let me do that? Completely useless.2. Trying to link a bank account to a paypal account. I provide bank account info. with which they're supposed to make ""two small deposits"" to your account. I'm supposed to use that info to verify the bank account.I waited days and nothing. I cancel that request and attempt the verification again...nothing. I try a third time and wait 5 days, nothing. So I contact them.I'm on the phone for 45mins, the agent assures me that paypal has sent the transactions to my bank, that the fault lies with my bank and I should contact them to resolve the issue. Right. After calling my bank and confirming that, no, paypal has not attempted any transaction or verification process with them. I call paypal...yet, again. I'm on with them another 30mins before the agent informs me that they'll just verify the bank account at their end and in 24hrs my bank account will be added to my paypal account....what!???! At any point in time with me speaking with them over the last two weeks, an agent could have just manually verified my bank account? WHY THE *** DIDN'T THEY JUST DO THAT TO BEGIN WITH!??!?3. I thank the agent for their assistance and (channelling my kindest inner Karen) ask if it would be possible for me to, please, speak to a supervisor.""Sure, please hold while find someone."" They're gone 1min, ""All our managers are on calls right now."" No problem I inform them I'm happy to hold. 5mins later, ""All our managers are still on calls. We would be happy to call you back."" No, thank you, but I really don't have faith that anyone will call me back, because I've done this dance with them before (They won't call you back, they deny the customer at any and every step. They wear you down so that you just give up trying and simply continue to let them milk you for fees).They keep checking if I'd prefer them to call me back because everyone is busy on calls. I tell them I'm perfectly happy to wait on hold, because I have little faith they'll attempt to call back. Eventually the agent comes back and instead of the call centre template ""All our managers are still on..."" they say, ""Sir? Sir?Are you still there?"" Which I am, I say I am, they feign that they can't hear me then they hang up.4. High fees. One of the worst in the industry. I'm just using my credit card from now on. Lower fees and I won't have to constantly phone paypal to allow me into my own account.5. paypal's contempt for it's customers is barely disguised. While you're on hold the friendly recorded message (aside from the ""your call is important to us"" schtick) continually suggests that instead of contacting paypal, the customer should submit their question, complaint or problem to the paypal community forum and have other paypal users offer assistance. Because why should paypal waste time or money to assist customers when other customers can do their job for them.6. Regarding complaint 1 and 2 Everything that a paypal customer service agent is doing when you're on a call with them, is exactly what we the customers should be able to do, on our own, without having to contact them. Every question they ask us and we provide the answer to, they input to their computers to gain access to our accounts. Everything they do is supposed to suggest that they are taking care of our security and interests, that they're needed by us. However, that's only because paypal causes so many problems for customers and arbitrarily denies us access to our accounts, that we are forced into begging for assistance.The exact same assistance we should be able to provide for ourselves if their website allowed us to.paypal is a parasitic blight, milking their customers whilst arbitrarily manufacturing the need for their assistance; which, in fact, is meagre at best, malignant at worst.

How does the merchant even have my account information for an account that doesn't even exist anymore if I've already removed it from PayPal?

Paypal favours big businesses - forget about refund,"I boooked a hotel with booking.com and paid with Paypal. Room was completely different than what was shown, a lot smaller than the size mentioned (172 ft sq) and lots of items were missing from description but the most important was the fan (provided that tehre was no air conditioning, and tempratures were 32+). they also asked me for a tax in cash whereas booking.com said all taxes are paid. The receptionists also told me that the pictures on booking.com are fake. i first contacted booking.com who refused to refund, and then Paypal who refused with a template message that item is neither damaged, nor any part is missing, and description states ""item is materially similar to seller'r description"". I wonder if i was booking a hotel or bought some material item :)it turns out paypal only refund for small businesses and individuals, but when it comes to bigger businesses, they dont even bother to read your claim.. i sent them pictures of the room given, the room promised, missing items, extra tax costs, and also booking.com response where they suggested to leave a negative review but forget about money refund.. i provided all of them but Paypal did not even consider any of them..having said that... i have been using paypal fo over 10 years.. and never disputed even once... first time i used it for hotel booking and disputed and got this treatment.. now its good to say.. bye bye Paypal... you dont deserve loyal customers. and shame on your dispute resolution team who favours bigger businesses only.",1,2022-07-27T19:57:53.000Z,Tausif

They are now claiming I owe them £128.64 because they footed the bill. My PayPal account is now $149 in debt because of PayPal. Instead of being responsible and DECLINING THE PAYMENT THEY TOOK MONEY FROM AN ACCOUNT WITH NO MONEY IN IT. WHAT A RESPONSIBLE FINANCIAL LENDER.

PayPal gave me personal call to tell me why the payment was withheld and that it will clear in 7 days.  So I stand to be corrected & I apologize for my lack of patience and unfair reaction to the misunderstanding. I'll wait till next week and conclude my review. For now I'm changing my rating from 1 star to 4 stars for the delayed response, but it is always encouraging for a company to fix things with a desgrantled client. Thanks.",4,2022-07-22T17:36:31.000Z,Mangaliso Xaba

20 years with Paypal for a kick in the rear!,"After more than 20 years Paypal decided to crap on me over a $21.00 dispute regarding a pizza order at Lenny's in Ormond Beach, FL. The pizza, ordered just before closing, was dropped to the floor, scooped up and placed in the oven and then put in a box and handed to me. I opened it and when I saw what they did I asked ""What the F is this??"" All kitchen employees exited the back door just minutes before the hostess handed the box to me. I returned the next day and some jerk in the kitchen took the pizza and threw it in the garbage. Because I used my Paypal card, I disputed the charge. After a month, and Paypal never requesting the store response, denied my claim. Paypal sucks! I withdrew my funds and will never use Paypal again and I strongly advise anyone who may think about using a Paypal card for purchases to use any other card instead.

I purchased a mattress from Dream cloud sleep/Icloud because they had a 365 days money back guarantee. I have had 2 back surgeries this is my reasoning for a Company with money back guarantee! They will pick up at my door No questions asked. My purchase was August 2021. I contacted Dreamcloudsleep.com on 1/27/22 the mattress was not supportive enough and starting to sag and discomfort for my back. They never responded I notified them on 2/1/22 after no response. PayPal would not help after 180 days of Purchase. I was directed to Synchrony Bank they have denied my dispute for a second time stating I need to pay shipping to return the mattress before Dreamcloud will refund my 1482.94 payment in Full. I have since closed my account do to the fact PayPal Customer Care is not for the honest customer that pays their salaries and keeps their business up and running. PayPal would rather support the Credit card company that is charging the highest interest rates to make up for the dishonest people that do not pay. Very Sad!

Gotten worse over the years?,"Been using it for years and years. And mostly they are on my side whenever a transaction goes bad. But this time.. The dispute isn't about the items, but the seller not informing properly. And since the business is in the EU and I'm in the EU, you'd think the business should obey European Consumer Laws. But since the resolution center is pretty bad at categories, they don't read the entire case, and just dismissed based on the actual category and proof shown. They are robots, not understanding that my case didn't fit anywhere. And yet they let them break trade laws.. It's quite horrific. So I filed a complaint with Paypal directly about this, hopefully they will read up on the EU trade laws and correct their mistakes. But I'm giving them a 2-star until futher notice.

Terrible company.,"This is my first time writing a trust pilot review, I signed up especially to warn others of this terrible company. I used Paypal for several years for my business, which  bizarrely enough was the only viable option at the time. Despite the constant issues, people's accounts being locked or limited, payments being kept on hold unable to be accessed for days etc. This, at least on my end, reduced in frequency the more I used my account. However, eventually one day my account was permanently limited, with no reason given and I was told that I might be able to withdraw my balance in 6 months, which they'd inform me about via email. I don't understand how such a company is legally tenable let  alone so widely used.

I received 2 payments from two separate clients and now my money is on hold for 21 days!!! When I called, I was told that my money is on hold because their system sees me as a new business and it wants to ensure that no issues will arise between my clients and I. In order to release the money sooner, they asked me to reach out to my paying clients and ask them to provide proof that I actually delivered services!!! I refused because it will seem as if I am doing something illegal and may raise a red flag with them. I have NEVER had to do such a thing. I am a legitimate business owner with an A-rating from the Better Business Bureau and lots of solid real reviews.

PAYPAL IS THE WORST!!! PLEASE READ!!!,"Bad reviews are never something I leave on businesses even when I have had less than positive service. However, this business (PayPal) is extremely unprofessional and the representatives lack skills to actually help with basic problems with member accounts. It's pathetic and extremely frustrating. I have $25 in my account that I have been trying to obtain in one way or another since it's MY money, yet they (PayPal customer service) keep telling me after hours and days of chatting/phone calls that they are having a hard time lifting the limitation on my account. No further explanation and almost as if they do not understand how simple of a request this is. I even went as far to request deactivation of the account and just a hard check in the mail of the remaining funds. No answer. How sad for a business that has been around this long and one that clearly makes a TON of money treats their customers like this.

Charged for failed transactions,The same situation has happened twice now. I try to make a purchase using PayPal and when I select “place order” it shows the transaction failed and to try later. The first time this happened I tried a few times and although the sale did not go through the charges did multiple times and I spent hours trying to fix the mess. I ended up ordering direct using my Mastercard. The 2nd time this happened I tried to place an order and got the same “failed” after having gone through this before I decided to check and sure enough the payment is “pending” after calling I confirmed twice that JCPenney had no record of any order. Since it failed I had no order number and they tried using different information to try finding the non existing order. PayPal refuses to remove the pending transaction for this. I have spent hours trying to explain this to PayPal and they keep telling me I have to cancel this order that DOES NOT EXIST. And they refuse to help.  Their solution was to wait 30 days and then file a dispute.  That is ridiculous. The order does not exist. They are no help whatsoever and not worth the hassle.

Thinking that Paypal has a buyer's protection they have been advertising throughout they years.   The scammer (from China) sent the items to different addresses ( I tracked it via Fedex) to make it appear that the item was delivered.   I filed a complaint to Paypal 9 times and my request  to get the refund was denied twice by the Paypal customer service and managers.How come they did the scammer get my money by just like that?  I've been a paypal customer for 12 years and I've closed it right away because of my frustrations.I am glad Ebay dumped Paypal because Paypal is a scammer's friend. It is easy to track that the item was delivered intentionally to the wrong address but they did not do an investigation at all.I urge everybody to stop using Paypal because they have not helped me atall in any transanctions over the course of 12 long years.Please avoid Paypal.

Finally found out that the direct debit should have gone out on a Saturday so they didn't bother, waited 7 days then tried again. They then worked out that was also a Saturday so tried another method.

ABSOLUTELY BEWARE!!!,"ABSOLUTELY BEWARE!!!! If I could give negative stars, I would. I set up a Paypal Business account as an additional way for my clients to transfer me payment. Since I have clients all over the world, I thought Paypal would be a good option. Almost immediately, I ran into issues. With a couple days of setting up my account and receiving my first payment, Paypal permanently limited my account with zero warning, zero explanation, and zero recourse for correction. They have been holding my client's payment for over 2 months now, and their customer service is, without exaggeration, the worst I've ever experienced. I have sent multiple emails trying to refund, transfer or release my client's funds (either back to them or to me) and get the same automated response that ""Paypal reserves the right to limit accounts for any reason, without explanation."" No other comments on the error messages I get when attempting to transfer the money - no help at all.Absolutely unacceptable.I will never use Paypal again, privately or for business.Anyone reading this, I advise you to use other forms of payment, like Zelle, Stripe or old school bank-to-bank wire transfer (standard here in the EU still). For international clients, I can't recommend Wise enough. Of course, Paypal's Trust Pilot score is 1.2 stars, and Wise is 4+. I should have checked before...Avoid Paypal at all costs. The convenience is not worth the risk. Awful, awful service.",1,2022-07-04T11:10:24.000Z,Mariah Arianna
"Unintuitive, unreliable and unfriendly","The PayPal interface is remarkably unintuitive. You can't set it to convert overseas payments into UK currency by default, instead having to wade through poorly labelled sub-menus to get your money out of foreign currency. I've just tried to register a new card and PayPal simply couldn't do it through the banking app. There are times when the web interface just reports errors, even for basic things like trying to withdraw money. No explanation is ever given - you're expected to know why something isn't working.As an aside, the customer service is truly awful. I only stay with PayPal because I have clients who can only pay me through this method - I have minimised my involvement as far as possible, switching to rival services wherever I can. I would close my account tomorrow if it wouldn't damage my company's turnover.",1,2022-07-04T10:43:08.000Z,Laura Cumins

In a nut shell,"In a nut shell, PayPal sucks...PayPal receives a profit by supporting the sellers (sometimes fraudulent sellers) that use them. PayPal does not support the purchasers. They support the sellers.Here's my situation...I ordered what were supposed to be natural, genuine gem stones from India. My father's BF and business partner was from India and he was a gem dealer so I assumed that I could trust these people.What I received was gem glass not natural gemstones.I tested the items and found them to be fake/counterfeit and PayPal wanted me to spend my own money to send the gems back to get a refund.The catch was the (fake) gems had to be returned in their original condition. Well, glass breaks. Gemstones don't. When you do a proper test, the stones are put under duress, heat and scratched.Naturally, fake (glass) gems will not fair like authentic gemstones.  They will suffer damage. How can I return them in their original condition when after testing, they are damaged because they're glass and not actual gems? If you want to purchase something, anything, use your credit card. Do not use PayPal. They do not protect consumers. PayPal protects their sellers and they're OK with their sellers committing fraud on purchasers. Word of advice, do not use your debit card or a PayPal account. Use your credit card. That way you can dispute a purchase that is fraudulent or or not what you expected.You're welcome.",1,2022-07-03T03:04:47.000Z,Hilary Glasser

Just a little warning about PayPal customer protection,"Just a little warning about PayPal customer protection. I had an unexpected automatic renewal charge for a software subscription that I stopped using shortly after I bout it. There was no mention of an automatic renewal on the vendor's website (and there still isn't) nor the email confirmation of the purchase. Also, there was no advance notification of the renewal from the vendor. The only mention that the annual subscription would automatically renew was shown lower down in the PayPal payment confirmation email which I didn't see at the time. Anyway, I disputed the charge with PayPal who requested further information within 3 days. I couldn't respond within the 3 days as I was travelling on business so they automatically rejected my claim.

Dispute resolution is absurd and…,"Dispute resolution is absurd and customer service largely useless.  I used PP at a merchant which turned out to be a scam.  I contacted PP immediately since someone was clearly hijacking their logo and app to have money sent to themselves.  I was immediately auto-denied, but then pleaded for help on chat.  Another person looked into it and when this scammer provided fake proof of delivery,PP believed him. I had already provided PP with plenty of evidence that this was fraud -- I had received no emails saying an order had been placed or that merchandise was on the way or that my order was being delivered by a certain date.  Indeed, the final receipt showed it was not a purchase but that somehow I had sent money to an unknown individual.  But PP ignored all of that. With this second denial, it took a lot of saying ""agent"" and pressing 0 on the phone to get to a human who said they would actually contact the courier (USPS) to validate. Of course, no one had bothered to double check before the denial of my claim, even as it was clear an individual  was scamming me.  PP continues to enable the scammers by their lackadaisacal attitude.  I will never use PP again. Hope it crashes and burns. Use your credit card backed by a good bank.

GOODBYE PAYPAL!!,"Called to find out if I could pay my VA with Paypal using a credit card. First I was told yes, no problem, and to wait for the instructions in my email. I never received an email.

It was optional to give my social security number, so I declined for security purposes. I wrote a contract between my VA and me along with a payment term agreement. I then tried to send my VA money. I was told I could not with an error message. I called and was told I was flagged for security purposes because I had not used PayPal before and would have to wait 72 hours to try to re-submit, but no promises that it would then be approved?? And because I did not give my SS#. Begrudgingly I gave my SS#, then also my Passport picture, and also a credit card statement. I received an email stating that my ""limitations"" had been lifted. Now late sending my payment that I agreed to send by contract (believing I would not have any issues since I verified before using this service) I tried again. Same error message. Thought, there is something wrong. I logged out, and back in. Same message. I gave in and gave my Debit card info just to get my VA their money. STILL, was declined.

no no no paypal.,"worst ever. they still wont give me my money which I will be finding out if is illegal. this is for my prepaid account which received a deposit from a vendor. they locked my account denying me MY money as they investigate how it came to be in my account.  you know, like it is any of their business. I call rep 1. she cant go off script and cant resolve the problem. so her solution was to put me on hold permanently.  second rep flat out lies.  now even though it is none of their business what transpired to prompt the deposit into my account they require my transaction records. during the first call I emailed them over.  the 1st rep says give them 6 hours to read 2 receipts.  a five year old could accomplish that task in five minutes.  I asked for a supervisor hence the endless hold.  rep 2 tells me after I tell her the paperwork although none of their business has been provided.  she says the lock is lifted and I can access my funds now.  I said now?  she said now.  so off to the atm i go.  total lie  i cannot access my funds. call back and get rep 3. again telling her all of the details (none of their business) and tell her that the last incompetent useless person I spoke with there said my paperwork was reviewed and the account was unlocked so why can I not access my my my money.  she starts to tell me that I have to provide the paperwork for the transaction.  a monkey really would have been less frustrating to speak with. I ask for a supervisor again and after 50 (that's fifty) minutes I get transferred to someone identifying themselves as Dylan.  I go through the details of the last 3 and a half hours with what should be his team right.  he starts running the same script at me.  then in an effort to condescend to me he stated well this is just a prepaid card not a real account (take note of what they think of all you paypal prepaid customers)  well silly little incompetent Dylan doesn't know how many accounts I hold with paypal who in a profound lack of judgement let's this group interface with their customers  but in his statement he should have been able to extrapolate, as any thinking person would that this account he looked down his ignorant nose at imposes no possible threat to paypal .  the money is in the account. my money.  so paypal is doing exactly what?  meddling into my life?  holding money that does not belong to them(some would call this stealing) for the purpose of acquiring interest (all would call this illegal), what. and is your big plan if you find your intrusion into my personal affairs isnt adequate. will you send the money to someone other than to whom it belongs,  keep it?  pretty sure both of those actions are illegal.  I swear if you put any of these people in a human sized paper bag as you left for the day they would still be in it when you returned.  do not, if you care about your money and having trust in you financial businesses, if you care about your blood pressure levels, if you care about trust and acting reasonable and in good faith, entrust a dime into the care of paypal.  ebay has a close relationship with paypal so I will be hitting them up to for at the minimum poor judgement and at the maximum putting their customers at risk and through hell just to conduct simple business.   by the way dylan. you do not qualify as a supervisor.  I wouldnt let you supervise my shoe laces.  you hung up on me.  if I were your boss you would be fired. if you hold a supervisory position then the actions of the group there make more sense but are still absolutely embarrassing to your business and any business who does business with you.  leaders lead.  you are not a leader.  finally paypal.  you are outside of the scope of your business model. if a horse clip cliopped in there and crapped money into my account it is my money and none of your business what compelled him to do so.  get back on your side of the net.",1,2022-06-18T23:33:56.000Z,Karla Wurzel

"Fraud protection? More like ""protecting frauds""","I must say PayPal was my favorite payment system. I always felt safe to use it as they offer easy payment management using many different credit cards, bank accounts etc. Almost 7 years I was happy with their payment service. However, ""customer service"" was a different story. I bought a digital subscription from a seller who promised 6 months of subscription. The subscription was cancelled only after a few days. The seller never responded to my requests. I reported fraud to PayPal and provided the proof of purchase, item description and communications with the seller. First PayPal asked me to return the product and show the proof of shipment. It was a digital item received in email, no physical item to ship. The phony seller knew his game. There was no human interaction. PayPal refused my claim. I contacted PayPal again and explained the situation. They rejected the claim once again saying ""your purchase is not protected under our user agreement"". I was frustrated to see that PayPal would rather team up with the swindler to make more money.

PayPal limited my account without prior…,"PayPal limited my account without prior notice and held my money for 180 days to cover any disputes. Their customer service always promised that they will release my funds after 180 days. I understand the hold, as if one of my customers we’re not satisfied with their product and wanted a refund, PayPal wanted to make sure I had the funds to reimburse. I logged in to my account after the 180 days passed to discover that PayPal stole my money and transferred all my balance to themselves under the false claim of nonexistent damages. There was no damage to PayPal and I believe their claims are false. Any disputes or returns were settled and all my customers were happy with their product. PayPal acted in bad faith and debited random arbitrary amounts to empty my balance to ZERO enriching themselves. PayPal transferred my whole balance and took my hard earned money of $3,313.23  Transaction ID 1BP14683EV963180D . Under the common law, liquidated damages may not be set so high that they are penalty clauses rather than fair compensation. I believe PayPal acted in bad faith as a payment company, they have failed to offer the promised service. I believe that I was deceived and scammed by PayPal and I want to complain about these corrupt acts. PayPal failed to provide the advertised payment service. I have tried to resolve this issue friendly with them a few times, but they have wrongly accused me of violating their Acceptable Use Policy.

But, I was deceived and the product was garbage, and not what I anticipated. The company said they would give me a partial refund because I was disappointed with their product. They charged me US funds which wasn’t made clear when I purchased the product either, I canceled the payment immediately after. I canceled the subscription and stopped automatic payments through Pay Pal. I did this all within the 72 hour window. This company that scammed me was giving me a hard time obviously. So I thought I would contact Pay Pal to demand them to give me a full refund or the partial refund that they promised me. They decided to side with them. Saying they didn’t have to give me a refund at all! They said I didn’t cancel the payment before I even paid it. What the hell is that? I purchased a product and I am demanding a refund because their website also says 100% money back guaranteed. Then in their policy it said if you are disappointed then contact us within 14 days for a partial or full refund. Then it says on another part that they don’t give refunds. So what the heck is it? What kind of return policy is that? So basically their policies are extremely contradictory. Another part of their scam. I am not the only person who had these issues so at least I don’t feel so dumb for falling for their bull. I guess upon further research (should have done that before, I know) there are so many bad reviews about this company. There is even youtube videos on it. The company promised me all of this and of course was giving me the run around. I have been in talks with them for over a week now. I am so frustrated, They just have to issue the refund to my card. Instead of Pay Pal helping me out with this, they made up this response and it makes zero sense. The money wasn’t charged automatically it was still pending on my visa for a while. They claim that I should have done it before it processed and I did. I cancelled within an hour after I realized how much I was charged and that I was deceived. The company responded within that time offering me the partial refund! I should be getting a full refund! Especially after all of this. Now they said to contact my bank… Are you kidding me? I still don’t know why this service exists. I used my visa through them. There’s literally no point. I just thought that I could use this service in case I had any fraudulent purchases. In this case I did! I was literally scammed, I thought they were to be used to protect customers, but I guess they are just as bad as these scam companies. Then when I tried to close my account with Pay Pal because I am so infuriated over this situation, they said they needed their “engineers” to fix the technical issues on their website. I want my account closed now and it says you cannot close your account and you have to contact customer service. At this point I can’t deal with them any further. I reported all of this to my bank in hopes I can get something back. I wouldn’t recommend any of these companies at all. This has been just such a waste of my time. It’s not like they took $15.00 like I thought I was paying. It said $15.00 per month also in the description of payment options. I ended up paying for a six month subscription which was around $95 US, then exchange rate cost me approximately $125 Canadian! That’s a huge difference. Overall, I am livid and I hope that by writing this review this will help someone else. Don’t use Pay Pal!",1,2022-06-17T04:39:14.000Z,Roccal

Liars,"Liars, Liars, Liars. They will fib you as long as it's convenient for them. I was a seller, accepting PayPal payments for many years. I never had one single problem or dispute. As my account was by default personal, I thought, that it might look more professional to change into business one. I spoke to PayPal business account adviser and I was completely assured, that if I convert my personal account into business account, my founds will not be put on hold as it usually happens with new accounts and I will be free to accept and receive payments as I used to. Assured by their representative, soon after I converted my account which was in outstanding performance into business account. Payment from my very next sale was placed on hold for mandatory 21 days, unless I do ALL those things : have an account in good standing for 60 days, accept over 200 pounds in sales, complete at least 10 transactions via Paypal and confirm my phone number. I spoke to the their representative and I WAS TOLD THAT ""APPARENTLY THINGS HAD TO CHANGE SINCE I LAST SPOKE TO THEM"" !!!!! Then I was assured, that my funds will be released once I mark my items as posted. I did. Guess what... They are still on hold 2 weeks later. I removed PayPal payment option from all my accounts and now I will only accept stripe !",1,2022-06-16T22:44:04.000Z,Agnes

Yesterday I had a fraudulent charge on a vendor I haven't shopped with using PayPal for 2.5 years.  After long hold, opened claim.  But had to call the merchant myself to stop them from shipping the item to an alternate address.  Merchant was in full agreement that it was fraud.  Then, PayPal denied my claim saying it wasn't fraud!  Two holds, two disconnects later, they are maintaining that since I had a Paypal agreement with vendor years ago, it couldn't be fraud!  PayPal is no longer protecting me.  Merchant agreed that they are seeing increasing problems with PayPal and encouraged that I find an alternative.

Don't Forget Your Password,"I had recently ordered a package from Europe. They were out of stock and had to cancel my order, no biggie. They took the liberty of transferring my refund through Paypal, which was where the problem truly began. I forget why I even made a PayPal. I think it was for a purchase off of Discogs that never ended up getting to me. I signed up for PayPal so someone could pretty much steal money from me, but that's not my issue today. I had to fight through the most annoying automated receptionist I've ever clashed heads with. The machine asked me for everything I didn't have, which was literally the reason I called. I ended up getting frustrated at the machine for wasting my time, and eventually yelled for a customer service rep. After about ten seconds of silence, I was put on hold.I haven't used my PayPal since I started it. The debit card I used as well as the phone number I used are all out of service. I tried to request a new password, but the only option for resetting your password is to get a phone call with a code. Since I used an old phone number, I can't physically get my code. I decided to call customer service. That didn't help me at all. The guy asked for the last few digits of the card I had used. I told him that card was cancelled so long ago that I don't even remember which card it was. I asked if he could send the confirmation code to my email, and he said the best he could do was to send me the code to my PayPal account itself. He tried sugar coating it, telling me that ""nobody can touch that money but you"". I made it clear that since there is physically no way for me to get into my PayPal account, that money is completely lost and I won't even be able to touch it. I guess there was a very good reason I didn't use PayPal. Also, make sure if your customer service agent is going to belch on the phone that the customer can't hear it.

But seeing money has been taken and no item recieved receipt or tracking and a customer service email that changes each time its contacted... it feels very much like thefts and mugging. I've decided not to use PayPal after this, reason the ordeal, and they have the illusion that all is well in the online shopping world free from scammers and foul practice, however that isn't realistic and really doesn't give the customer the option to challenge. The amount was a small sum, fortunately its been a lesson. However, I don't make the habit of giving money away to scammers or online cons for the sake of it.

Paypal 'steals' funds from our bank account then charge us a fee to be reimbursed what they stole?!,"A buyer sent $875 to our Paypal account in error.Paypal notified us PP was holding this money & advised us that ""buyer"" had disputed this transaction.Of course we agreed to fully refund the $875.Instead of reimbursing the buyer from the funds Paypal were holding Paypal deducted $875 from our bank account (we had never received those funds in the first place!! they were holding those funds!!).When I saw our bank account in overdraft,  I logged onto Paypal & next found a notice saying $872.97 now available to transfer to our bank account & it will take 4 days to receive! (despite PP stealing the funds same day, somehow it takes 4 days to reimburse them!)Meanwhile now our bank account is in Overdraft. 4 days later when we (hopefully) receive the funds from Paypal it will be less a fee.I gave permission to release funds PP were ""holding"" in our name, I did not give permission to deduct funds from our account.List of flaws:1. PP failed to prevent an erroneous payment (where's the verification process?)2. PP deducted funds from our bank account without our permission (theft)3. PP were holding those funds & had never paid into our bank account so why deduct from our bank account.4. $872.97 'magically' appeared into our PP account.  & we had to manually request to transfer funds from our PP account to reimburse our bank account (now in overdraft), which will take 4 days! & a fee of $2.03, or 1 day & a $13 fee! (when PP were able to automatically deduct $$ from our account, why should we have to manually request reimb?)Deducting $875 from our account without our permission is theft or at least fraudulent practice.No small business would get away with this flawed procedure, surely a company with revenue of $25billion (2021) could get this simple process right.In summary - If PP is holding funds from a buyer, & permission is given to refund the buyer, why steal funds from a 3rd party?",1,2022-06-11T14:59:17.000Z,Laura Stewart

"No package ever delivered, yet charged anyway!","I ordered online a relatively expensive product through a PayPal Vendor.  I never received product even though they claimed it was delivered. I have a doorbell camera where packages are left in my front door area. No package from them was ever delivered on that date or any other date. If so, I would have had a video of it being delivered. Also, I would have had a video if there was a porch pirate. Neither that delivery or porch pirate happened! Ironically, I had an Amazon package delivered that same day at the same address and had no issues what so ever. In addition, my US Mail letters were delivered that same day with no issues. I was home the entire day of that supposedly delivered package. (NO Package was ever delivered to my address from them.) I emailed the vendor 3 times and he never even had the courtesy of a reply.

Well, that alone upset me because there was nothing I could do as PayPal told me that they couldn't cancel the transfer which they were the only one's who could cancel the transaction. However, I go today, June 6th, 2022 to get MY money from MY PayPal account and the money has yet to be put into MY PayPal account. Now, it wasn't like I was requesting money from someone overseas, I was just transferring money from MY verified bank account to MY PayPal account and I still am waiting for MY money on the 6th day during this great electronic and computer age! Mr. Musk you should be ashamed of yourself. PayPal should notify each individual, when transferring money, of the expected time delay.

PAYPAL is robbing it's customers,"I used my Paypal debit card to pay for an item online.

I haven't received the refund and I am being told that the money was refunded 2 days(which is the same day of the transaction) before I filed the dispute. I just spent 1hour 18 minutes and 57seconds on the phone with 2 different departments just being told oh PAYPAL knew i wasn't receiving the merchandise so they refunded the money before I had to ask for it but the transaction ID's dont match and absolutely nothing references the transaction ID. Paypal is stealing money from people and they hope we are dumb enough not to catch it. How is it that on May 26th, 2022 I receive the email stating I was going to receive the refund in 5 days but yet every person i spoke to on the phone(having read the prior persons notes) is telling me oh we gave you the money before you asked for it. It just took the email time to catch up. The last person I spoke with tried to tell me the email i received on May 26th stated that I had already received the refund. When I asked her about her statement as I had the email pulled up in front of me to please read the email and point out where it stated I had received the refund.

Depending on your card issuer, it can take up to 30 days for the refund to appear on your card statement.There is no date that a refund was offered and since I just happen to have a refund on my account on the same day that I bought an item from someone else they are saying that is my refund!Anyone else see the thievery coming from PAYPAL.

Customer service has done nothing to help but mark my dispute as resolved rather than helping with the actual issue. Even the complaints email section won't let me send an email to complain about the customer service.All round horrible, I can't wait to close my account and im making sure all my friends and family do the same.",1,2022-05-30T23:11:27.000Z,Matthew Scott

PayPal took $40k from our company,"PayPal froze our company account for no reason. The only explanation was that our business was ""high risk"" because we work with crypto investors. They froze $40k. We were told that this hold would be released after 180 days. After the 180 days they did not release the funds and we are still fighting to get our money from Paypal. They will not tell us why our funds are frozen. We have only had one compliant filed and tis was for a $30 tshirt that arrived to our customer late. Paypal is putting our company in jeopardy with no explanation and zero communication. They ignore all emails and managers tell me that they cannot tell me what is going on, and they themselves cannot contact the ""back office"" for answers. Shortly after they froze our account we switched to Square and everything was great there. Please DO NOT USE PAYPAL if you are a business owner.

I even wrote to Paypal in Luxembourg enclosing a copy of my passport but did not receive any response. I was only finally able to access my account again in September 2021 after  contacting the Financial Ombudsman Service. The FOS upheld my complaint and told Paypal to send me a written apology.  However all they said was that ""Paypal would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused when attempting to log into your PayPal account"" which is similar to an apology for a late running train! Paypal also decided to deny the facts and claim that I had been able to access my account all along; effectively accusing my of lying! The mistake I made was not keeping a detailed log of all the live chat and telephone conversations which is difficult to prove years later. This is the worst company I have ever had to deal with as they never reply to your requests and cannot resolve anything.

No... No I didn't, i entered $51.94 because that is exactly what i spent. I would have no reason to have entered an incorrect price. Their response was just the same.

My Experience Became Worsened Over the Years,"PayPal has underpaid workers acting like they will help people solve their problems. It is all an act, though. Over the years, my experience from PayPal has worsened. Considering the world is on fire because ultra-rich elites are making people poorer, dumber, and more threatened by profitable wars than before, I am not surprised by PayPal's lack of professionalism these days. This is the sign of increasing corruption in international businesses.These greedy sellouts who run PayPal do not care about innocent people being threatened in Ukraine nor Russia. America's military is involved in a proxy war in Ukraine for money and power. America's antisocially greedy elites will never bring justice in Ukraine. PayPal is a pretentious company asking people to give their money to Ukraine's war that America and Russia's oligarchical militaries caused. But since mainstream media like PayPal has cowered down to American imperialism, it will not be honest about what is happening in Ukraine nor Russia. It will only benefit America's ultra-rich lobbyists and bribers who elect these virtue signalling politicians with their Orwellian government.",1,2022-05-26T21:17:47.000Z,Nicole

"Paypal ""supposedly"" wants to help Ukraine","Was trying to send money to Ukraine for relatives to live off of since there is a war going on. Thought Paypal would be a good way to do this. ABSOLUTE WORST DECISION. The money is frozen in her account, and they are saying that it is frozen for 6 months due to ""security"" reasons that no one can share. We offered to show all our documents and even bank statements along with tax papers proving that this money is ours and we are relatives. But they will only say the same thing to you. Went as far as trying to reason with customer support support representative, who belittled us by saying we should have read the small print in the contract, while we tried to explain that this money is to live off of. Pleaded for them to help us, however they believe it is correct to freeze 5,000$ and deny Ukrainians a means to live off of help during this hard time for them. Customer support is absolutely terrible. Everyone understands and everyone is very polite in telling you kindly to get lost. Hope this sheds light to how Paypal is supposedly supporting Ukraine right now. Also their contract is as abstract as Picassos paintings. with vague sentences about blocking an account due to ""Send or receive what we reasonably believe to be potentially fraudulent funds;""Well that is lovely, and what does that mean?

Closure of Pay Pal Account,"I canceled my Pay Pal account today. The customer service agent said that the reason I could not view my account balance was because I had to use Chrome or IE browsers. I asked the agent to tell me what the balance due amount was and what the items were that I was paying for. The customer service agent asked me many times, over and over, just to pay the amount. When I asked to be transferred to an IT person who could assist me to navigate my account, the agent again asked me repeatedly for the amount due. I explained to the agent that I do not pay for items unless I know what they are for. She refused to transfer me for help. It was ridiculous!! I told her I was irate and refused to pay and wanted to close my Pay Pal account. She still refused to transfer me to someone to view my account. She told me that if I canceled my Pay Pal account I would never be able to open a Pay Pal account ever again. I told her to cancel the account. She repeatedly asked me if I wanted to pay the amount due. I finally found out what the debt was for, paid for it, canceled my account and when they asked why I was canceling I told her that they were rude, the company was rude and Pay Pal agents are rude and did not help customers at all. She kept saying, over and over ""ma'am don't you want to pay your bill?"" These people are hard to understand too and use that as an edge to quickly reply with the same thing they just said.

Dire company. Avoid,"I was shocked when I saw just how bad people rate PayPal.

Contacted the bank. Surprise, surprise,  no issue at all.Recontact PayPal and simply told to wait and see if I can use my payment method in the next few days.This company must be almost completely automated , working on algorithms or something.It's certainly pants and as soon as I'm able to move my funds without loss I will do.

Just terrible,"PayPal has the absolute worst customer service. They charged fees without informing me and even refused to say how much was charged. Then they wrongfully debited my account without warning, claiming that I received duplicate refunds. When I called customer service, the ""account specialist"" belittled me and called me ""dear"". So condescending and unprofessional. This same person even said ""who do you need to explain this to you for you to understand?"", as if I was the confused one. No matter the evidence I provided, she said that their system is flawless and that I'm wrong. She literally yelled at me and said ""no, the system is correct, you were refunded twice! You owe PayPal x amount of $!"". I told her that I confirmed with my credit card company that I never received such refund but she wouldn't even listen. Ridiculous. They are the ones that actually owe me money since they took my money from horrible exchange rate and fees I didn't even know about (over $100). She also tried to connect me to her supervisor saying that her supervisor agrees with her, but I was never connected. She said ""you're welcome"" before putting me on hold and just hung up on me. The very next day PayPal credited most of what they took (I guess they looked into it and found what was wrong? I had to spend 5 hours on the phone and chat with them for this to happen though). However, I still had a negative balance because they took more money than refunded. After talking to several different customer service specialists, they offered me a voucher I can use on my next purchase. I just accepted that and paid off the negative balance. I'm still losing more than $100 though. It's just not worth any more of my time to get that money back. PayPal's messaging system is a complete joke as well. They closed the message on me twice, without resolving my issue or answering my question. I had to connect again and ask the same question.",1,2022-06-07T02:11:41.000Z,Chloe S

Why online shoplifters prefer Paypal???,"Will completely stop using Paypal. Sold an item on eBay to a buyer that claimed the set was incomplete, despite I have proof the weight on the receipt shows that she was lying. Anyway I provided a label so she could return the item for a refund. She refused to open the case with eBay to open it with Paypal. Guess what? Paypal let her keep the item and the money. Lucky me, I was protected by Ebay selling protection otherwise if it was for Paypal I would have lost the item and the money. I can't understand why the online returns legal dispositions were totally ignored by Paypal, violating my legal rights. Buyers are not entitled to keep the items and the money when the seller has already paid and ptovided a return label.

I tired the message chat help function but you have to be logged in to use that suuuuuuper helpful that is.I attempted to call the help line and 033 number isn't recognised as a real phone number by my mobile (package includes call to all Irish numbers) and the 1800 number which comes up as Paypal Dundalk gets cut off after about 2 rings which is strange, as if someone saw it was a mobile and cut it off purposefully. Reached out to help team on Twitter and got sent copy/paste response sending me in circles to ''community help'' section and led back to the phone numbers, but it wasn't even in a direct manner. They told me the steps but left out that the section they were talking about was actually in a sub-section of the help part of their site, and did not bother to link me their, only to their homepage. I explained it wasn't working and again got copy/pasted bot-like response from their twitter. Don't believe there's any human interaction except picking template answers.

Okay,…..closed my account 4 years (!!!) ago with great difficulties and the help of customer service (no bank related problems just stupid PayPal),or so I thought.So then let’s create a new one, easy enough…….NO! There’s an existing account with my email address (and old phone number) already so please log in. W*F!!!! 😡So let’s play guess the password because obviously I don’t remember it after 4 years but we’ll give it a go. Doesn’t work obviously so you press the forget password button to get a reset link. And then they want extra confirmation via your phone. That number does not exist any more so you can’t reset the password and guess what,…. You can only change your phone number when you are logged in (obviously) and you can’t log in without a phone number. You can also only contact PayPal if you are logged in (or use social media accounts if you use them). W*F!!! Again So now after 4 years I still have massive trouble with PayPal to no fault of mine and can’t get in touch with them either. Worst possible way to pay for stuff and overpriced too.

Paypal will not do the right thing,"I had switched my primary bank account funding source on May 2, 2022. I did this because I opened up a new bank account and was closing the old one. By doing this it had made, in theory, the new account listed as the primary defaulted funding source, and the old account as a back up funding source. On May 3, 2022 to May 6, 2022 I had made some charges through by debit Mastercard with them. A total of 5 charges in which they now refuse to collect the amounts on the proper primary defaulted account that I listed with them. Instead they continue to try and charge my old bank account which I have since deleted from the platform. This has caused me to incur a large amount of insufficient bank fees and the account will not close now as a result of their poor actions. I have been on the phone with them twice, both times told that they would fix this and both times outright lied to because it keeps happening. I have resorted to electronic communication with them, and now I am on my 5th attempt to get this resolve as they keep pretending they have no idea what I am talking about. This is CRIMINAL behavior. At this point I am putting them on notice that since they do not want to do the right thing, that they are 100% responsible for all my banking fees and will be going after them for paying. On top of all this they have of course restricted my account because they refuse to collect upon the charges I made through the right bank account.

Then one day a guy gave me $700 then charged back $700 leaving me with a -700 dollar PayPal balance, I thought “okay this is probably a common scam and it should get resolved quickly” ohhh boy was I wrong… I went through weeks every day calling them speaking to 100s of different people, probably 20 hours combined of talking to brick walls, just to get told by some high ranking employee “there’s nothing we can do” so I hang up, and refuse to pay my negative balance, PayPal literally robbed me of $700 so there’s no way I should be expected to pay that, afew days later I got a letter from a creditor demanding I pay $700. Luckily I was a minor at the time so I was able to pull that card and get out of it, if I wasn’t I would’ve been robbed $700. Anyway recently aka yesterday I was forced to use PayPal to sell items of mine for quick money which I need badly at the moment for personal reasons, as much as I dreaded signing up again I had to, so I sold $1000 worth of items and guess what?? Despite the buyer of my items already having the items I now have to WAIT 21 DAYS TO GET MY MONEY, they are holding my money, of which should be mine for no reason.

It used to be the gold standard now is a total mess. I’ll always hear the stories about getting your account banned but didn’t pay too much attention to it wondering if people did really violate their policies. Then it happened to me, I had a personal account for over 15 years (which I successfully closed today thank God) and then opened a business account and got banned right away for 180 days. No apparent reason, just an AI doing his job and beautiful algorithms designed by a nerd with no human social skills. No customer support whatsoever nobody could tell me why they banned the account. It had money in it, so I will have to wait till December to start a dispute. PayPal outlined in the email they sent me that I was a high risk customer, but you know what, in reality PayPal is the one who should be tag as high risk, freezing accounts, withholding money with no explanation, no investigation, making accusations and assumptions, impossible customer service, etc. Switch to Stripe, they have better reviews and so far are working fine.

Then had an email saying that the case would close in 2 days if I didn't escalate, logged in and escalated and then received an email saying the case was now closed as I hadn't escalated! Trying to ring customer services was a joke, number is well hidden and trying to find the right combination of options to actually speak to someone is nearly impossible. Eventually spoke to someone who said that as I was a loyal customer they would get the technical team to look at why my escalation didn't register and get back to me. Heard nothing so tried ringing again 4 weeks later but repeatedly cut off, used the online messaging to message advisor but whilst I was typing it logged me out due to inactivity, finally found an email address to complain to and received a response saying that because of their policies there is nothing they can do and I should go through the small claims courts!

My experience with Pay Pal in the last…,"My experience with Pay Pal in the last few years was nothing but the daylight robbery from the Pay Pal side so I've decided to make purchases on Ebay and Amazon and pay by my debit card since. A few days ago, I've realized the money is missing from my account, withdrawal made by Pay Pal account. When I've contacted them, they've explained to me that I have authorized a payment for some gaming subscription for a year and set up the Direct Debit to GDC Media ltd. To explain my case, I am 57 years old and never played no games in my life time and wouldn't know how to if my Life depends on it and I live alone - so nobody else could do on my behalf. Pay Pal ''faked'' their compassion but still told me that it was authorized and I can't get my money back. I've tried to close my Pay Pal account and they wouldn't let me even though the case is closed. So of course, notified my bank, stopped any further withdrawal, past the case to fraud department and ordered new bank card! All this because I've had an account with Pay Pal and decided to pass my bank details to anyone to withdraw money, set up direct debit and make subscription without my knowledge. They are thieves and I suggest everyone close their account with them if they wanna protect their money",1,2022-04-30T03:20:51.000Z,Zehra

Do Not Use PayPal You Will Regret!,"If I could give them a no Star I would! DO NOT USE PAYPAL. Their company lacks responsibility and would not help you when there is a fraud transaction!!I started using PayPal a week ago to purchase flowers for my Grilfriend oversea. I didn't want to use my credit card to pay in a foreign website so I chose PayPal since I thought they would protect my money in case of any fake website scam. So that went smoothly. However few days later while I was asleep at 3AM, my PayPal got hacked and three transactions went through with three PlayStation codes bought through a website called Dundle. There was actually another transaction that was in process to go through but somehow got canceled. After I did some googling, apparently Dundle is a sketchy website as well and a lot of ppl got scammed/was charged without ever heard of the website. Anyhow, I contacted PayPal to investigate the unauthorized transaction, and they replied three hours later telling me they have reviewed and determined no unauthorized transactions happened. Now my first thought was they wanted to brush me off because an investigation shouldn't be this short... Nevertheless, I later called PayPal to ask for their explanation how they came to that conclusion, and the customer lady said there was no suspicious IP address that had logged into my account (I found out that a hacker with trojan malware can easily fake an IP) and therefore determined no unauthorized activity and all she told me was to call my bank to resolve this...Let me warn you...PayPal's security is a total disaster, when i queried the customer lady why they don't have otp in place, all she told me was that their system only needs someone to log in to make a transaction... And when I asked her why didn't they catch any suspicious activity when one transaction was stopped but three transactions of the same purchase went through all within 5 mins, and she said that is how PayPal payment works. Also, many people online complained about the company Dundle and how they got scammed/charged on PayPal without ever buying from them, but PayPal took no action over the years to protect their customers from falling into a pishy company like Dundle!I told her I am going to take this to the local police to investigate and I asked if the police found a fraudulent case would PayPal refund the money. She said their company will have to investigate further to determine, as if the police's report aren't credible enough. WHAT A JOKE! DO NOT TRUST PAYPAL!

Affreux - incompétents et impolis.,"As this ended up on the UK site, here's an English version:Awful! Incompetent and extremely rude. I wanted to purchase goods with my UK PayPal account, but to do so I needed to receive a code on my UK landline, but I'm at my French flat! So I opened a second, French account, put in the details of a different card and received a welcome email. But I couldn't use it - I had not been able to enter the (UK) postcode associated with the card because the site was configured only to accept French postcodes - so why no message that the card had not been added? I needed to telephone to find out that French PayPal only accepts French and US cards. It was very hard to obtain this information as the woman on the phone would not stop talking (including when I was trying to talk to her), endlessly repeating the same sentences, doubtless written out for her. I thought I was talking to a machine not a human being.  Avoid at all costs if you can.They deserve to go bankrupt.Affreux! Incompétents et extrêmement impolis. Je voulais effectuer un achat avec mon compte paypal britannique mais pour l'utiliser je devais recevoir un code sur mon fixe à ma maison là-bas, mais je suis à mon appartement en France. J'ai donc ouvert un 2ème compte, français, j'ai saisi le numéro d'une autre carte et j'ai reçu un courriel de bienvenue. Mais impossible de l'utiliser - je n'ai pas pu saisir le code postal (britannique) associé à la carte le site n'étant configuré que pour les codes français - alors pourquoi aucun message que la carte n'avait pas été enregistrée? Il a fallu téléphoner pour découvrir que PayPal France n'accepte que les cartes françaises et américaines. Il a été très difficile d'obtenir cette information car la femme au téléphone ne cessait de parler, parler, parler - tout le temps en répétant les mêmes phrases certainement pré-écrites - je pensais avoir affair à une machine.

"Worst Business ""Partner""","We've paid PP well over $50k in fees over the past few years to use their mass payout solution.

Bulls***, you hold the money because you make incremental interest via MM funds and pass the blame off to others.3) Their fees are outrageous - They will nickel and dime you the entire way until they've carved out 5-10% of your profit margins with their fees.4) I've heard horror stories from ex-employees, along the lines of ""it's a complete s***show over there."" There is no cohesion between PP and the companies they've acquired (e.g. Braintree and Hyperwallet). For f*** sake Braintree can't even deposit money directly to Paypal and it's a PP solution, which brings me to...5) It takes weeks to transfer money from BT to PP. There is simply no excuse for this. Coinbase can instantly transfer money to my bank and to Paypal. Their excuse is ""the bank holds the money..."" Guess what, you can bipass the banks by going directly from Braintree to PP but you refuse to because either a) you can charge more fees by going indirect or b) you are too unorganized to integrate your own two companies.There are plenty of other solutions out there that are more innovative. We are switching to Checkbook.io which seems like a much better, more modern solution for our needs and charges, what we've calculated, to be about 20% of what PP charges.",1,2022-04-08T16:42:08.000Z,Seth Hurd

Net or a merchant and remove this scammers from your website if you are scaling. it won’t hurt your conversion too bad but it will save you a big amount that you gonna sacrifice if they suspend your account.

I'm stuck with these people,"I'm stuck with these people! But I can try to discourage you from using them. Paypal has absolutely reprehensible customer service personnel! They employ the most unhelpful group of people they could find. Pretty sure they just hired a bunch of rejected McDonald's employees only with less useful skills. And unless you want to pay their fees, don't look for your money transfer in anything less than 2 full weeks. On top of all this, they'll ask you for personel banking login information too! And not let you by without giving them your personal information until their site decides to let you past it. Which could take days! So nothing you try to pay with them will get done anytime soon. Just trust me use another pay site other than PayPal!",1,2022-04-07T22:08:59.000Z,Mike Mark

Awful all the way around,"The whole experience with PayPal every single time is a nightmare.   The only reason I’ve ever used them again was because that is how a customer chose to pay, usually right after they see my experience and see their money didn’t come through to me, I can talk them to switching over to CASH APP (which I’ve never once had a problem with) they repeatedly tell me that I am not who I say I am, they hold the money every single time when it is supposed to be I am money in minutes service, they are incompetent and they charge a fee which other services do not and they are also 100 times better! Hopefully this review helps someone to sway away from them and not have to deal with many of the issues myself and my friends have had to deal with… but I am very confident that they will not stay on top for long,  businesses like cash app and Zelle which are free and which do not hold the money are definitely going to knock them out of the way soon!",1,2022-04-07T16:05:36.000Z,Nicki White-Liberto

Customer Service is a JOKE,"Used to be long time customer. Until recently they decided to restrict my account for no reason. Every time i call them or message them, I get a bot reply of how i violated their terms of service or i have a high risk factor. I ask them the specifics and again get the same reply. I never sold anything thro paypal, nor did any of my transactions fail. God knows how these guys decide to restrict people account out of the blue. I used to use PayPal as my payment method when possible due to the ease.

I have very high PC security and have not replied to any scam emails, so I have no idea how they managed to gain access to my PayPal account password (probably someone working on the inside of PayPal, but you will never prove it). They used my account to buy three £100 PlayStation top-ups from shopto.net. It appears I'm not the only one either when you look at the shopto and PayPal trustpilot page.PayPal deny all responsibility as they say the transaction wasn't unauthorised. I have contacted the police, Action Fraud and the financial ombudsman service.I cancelled the direct debit with my bank, so PayPal  used an old de-registered card to take the money from my bank account. That has to be fraudulent!Don't use PayPal and feed criminal pockets! Use a debit or credit card for your purchases, at least you get protection from your banks.

Paypal is a rogue company!,I must say it out loud that Paypal is a rogue company. It will permanently suspend your account for no reason at all without giving a clear reason. I suddenly received a notice from paypal that my account was permanently suspended because I was involved in fraud. But my online store hadn't even started operating yet.

They freeze them for 6 months and after that they made an unauthorized transaction to PayPal with all the available balance.

Customer Support Comedians,Just received the worst customer support I've ever had. I've been locked out of my Paypal account because I have a balance of -£10 so I called customer support to get help. I spent 45 minutes on the phone and it still had not been sorted.  I was passed from person to person in the UK then onto the USA only to be passed around there only to be told I should be speaking to someone in the UK. Then when I spoke to the person in the UK they told me I had to be transferred again they then kept me on the line for another 5 mins of silence and gave me the number: 8888955705 which was a dead-end number. I then tried to call back and was told that customer support had closed. Was this intentional? I don't know.  I missed one email and now my account has been shut down for the sake of £10? This hardly seems justifiable and to top it off with sub-par and incompetent support workers really makes the already painful kick in the balls a lot worse. My experience with Paypal has been positive up to this point and I have spent a lot of money through them too. Makes me wonder if it is even worth sorting my account out? Who knows? Not me that's for sure.,1,2022-04-04T18:23:56.000Z,Tom “Tommy”

All I can say is that if you decide to…,"All I can say is that if you decide to just want a normal non-business account, forget it!!! It's been a horrible experience trying to change from a business account to a non-business account or a personal account. Especially if you have cards linked to the old account. It should be easy to switch accounts and transfer cards over. Plus in the very beginning when I opened an account I had a YouTube channel and put a donate paypal link on the channel, well paypal automatically gave me a business account which my channel was not a business. They charged me for every donation. So I found out all this after the fact and wanted a normal account. Well it's been horrible trying to get it setup. I have a new email address on top of it all to make matters worse. It's like they aren't setup for complicated scenarios such as mine. I'm to the point that I'm going to stop using paypal and find another service that is easier to use and that doesn't charge me for every transaction and is easier to setup with multiple cards and emails and that doesn't automatically enroll me into a business account based on donations... Also with the new account I'm having trouble getting my phone number verified which is a normal mobile number I've used forever! It said my type of number couldn't be used! What!!!
